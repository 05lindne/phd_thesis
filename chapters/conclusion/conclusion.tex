   In conclusion we found a strongly inhomogeneous distribution of \siv spectra in nanodiamonds.
   We group the \zpls into two groups:
   \Hl consists of \ZPLs exhibiting a narrow \lw from below \SI{1}{nm} up to \SI{4}{nm} and a broad distribution of \cwl between \SIlist{710;840}{nm}.
   Compared to that, \vl comprises \ZPLs with a broad \lw between just below \SIlist{5; 17}{nm} and \cwl ranging from \SIrange{730}{742}{nm}.
   This data is consistent with previously measured SiV spectra \cite{Benedikter2017a,Neu2012}.
   For comparison, an \siv in unstrained bulk diamond exhibits a \lw of \SIrange{4}{5}{nm} at a center wavelength of \SI{737.2}{nm}\cite{Arend2016a,Dietrich2014}.
   We show that both the observed blue-shift and the observed red-shift of \vl are consistently explained by strain in the diamond lattice.
   Further, we suggest, that \hl might be comprised of modified \sivs, the structure of which is currently unclear.
   \\
   We investigated the SiV sidebands:
   In \vl we found one prominent peak at a shift of \SI{42}{meV}, which corresponds to a well-known feature assigned to non-localized lattice vibrations \cite{Larkins1971,Sternschulte1994}.
   In \hl we see an accumulation of peaks, at around \SIlist{43;64;150;175}{meV}, which are consistent with sideband peaks reported in \cite{Sternschulte1994,Zaitsev2001,Neu2011}.
   \\
   We further reported photon autocorrelation measurements which verified the existence of single \sivs both in \hl and \vl.
   Investigating the time trace of the \siv \pl, we found that some \sivs exhibit fluorescence intermittence with on times between several microseconds up to \SI{41}{s}.
   Furthermore, we see an exponential distribution of bright time intervals and a log-normal distribution of dark time intervals, consistent with research on single molecules \cite{Wong2013}.
   In terms of photostability, there is a big difference between \vl and \hl:
   All but one emitters in \hl exhibit blinking, where only one of the emitters in \vl exhibits blinking.
