\chaptermark{Crystal Quality}

To improve crystal quality, two methods were used: annealing in vacuum and oxidation in air.
We investigated the effect of both approaches on the \ZPL.
We also investigated the effect of oxidation on the Raman spectrum.
Further Raman measurements of various samples give further insight to crystal quality and surface contamination.
At last, several TEM measurements exhibit the composition of the wet-milled \nds. 

	\section{Annealing and Oxidation}

	At temperatures above \todo{enter value}, vacancies in the diamond lattice become mobile and diffuse towards the surface\cite{}.
