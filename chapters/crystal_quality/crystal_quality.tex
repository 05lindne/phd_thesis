\chaptermark{Crystal Quality}

\begin{remark}
		Das kapitel sollte nochmal ueberarbeitet werden. Vom logischem aufbau her ist es gut, ich hab aber den eindruck es gibt noch loecher die man stopfen sollte.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item In der introduction werden qualitaetsprobleme genannt und ein paar methoden die da helfen sollen. Hier muss noch kurz erwaehnt werden warum die methoden helfen.
			\item In der ersten section sind annealing und oxidation zusammen. Im text steht aber nur was annealing oder? Falls oxidation dann erst in der naechsten section kommt, sollte man die ueberschriften aendern. Ich kenn mich halt nicht aus, d.h. das passt noch nicht.
			\item Was die surface treatments bewirken sollen bzw. wie die die qualitaetsprobleme minimieren? Da ist auch von shells die rede und ich hab keine ahnung was das fuer dinger sind. Hier fehlt auch noch was.
			\item Wenns um \TEM messungen geht, dann ist hier auch von \nd boundaries die rede. Hier sollte jetzt auch eine diskussion boundaries einfliessen, bzw. was fuer effekte die haben koennen.

In this chapter we gauge the cristal quality of the \nd samples examined in this thesis. In this context, crystal quality is a measure of how close the diamond crystal resembles its pristine form. Since we are interested in \sivs, the presence of other lattice imperfections such as additional vacancies, impurities or the includion of graphite or amorphous carbon are detremental. Superfluous imperfections negatively manifest themselves through \pl spectra characterized by broad \bkg flourescence.
\\
To improve crystal quality and to mitigate the mentioned effects the following methods are depoyed here: Annealing in a vaccuum, oxidation in air as well as surface treatments involving plasmas\todo[fancyline]{Hier fehlt jeweils ein kurzer satz was die dinger bewirken sollen.}.

To study the effectiveness of these treatments we rely on Raman and TEM spectroscopy. The former is used to detect the presence of carbon in non-diamond phases, while the latter enables imaging of individual \nds revealing details in crystallinity such as crystal boundaries.

	\section{Post-Processing Treatments}

		\subsection{Annealing and Oxidation}\label{sec::ann_ox}

		During \si implantation the diamond lattice gets damaged by the penetrating ions.
		sp$^2$ bonds, carbon interstitials and vacancies disrupt the metastable equilibrium of the diamond phase. Hence, there is a tendency for damaged diamond to "tip over" to the thermodynamically stable form of carbon, i.e. graphite.
		At temperatures above about \SI{500}{\celsius}, vacancies in the diamond lattice become mobile and diffuse towards the surface\cite{Dresselhaus1992}.
		Literature suggests, that annealing at \SI{900}{\celsius} for \SI{1}{\hour} is sufficient to remove most of the damage following implantations, that however some damage remains even after annealing at \SI{900}{\celsius} for \SI{1}{\hour}.
		To reduce the damage in the diamond lattice, we anneal the implanted diamonds at \SIrange{900}{1200}{\celsius} for \SIrange{3}{6}{h} in vacuum (\SI{e-6}{Pa}).
		\\
		The surface of the \nds is contaminated with graphite and amorphous sp$^2$ hybridized carbon \todo[fancyline]{warum}.
		The vacancies which diffuse towards the surface during annealing further increase the amorphous carbon content on the surface of the \nds \cite{}.
		We apply oxidation in an oven under ambient air at a temperature of \SI{450}{\celsius} for \SIrange{3}{6}{h}.

		\subsection{Surface Treatment With Gas And Plasma}

		% Cardiff
		We wanted to know wether surface treatment with different gasses had an influence on the emission properties, so we treated them with hydrogen (\ch{H2}), oxygen (\ch{O2}), ozone (\ch{O3}) all both at room temperature and at \SI{500}{\celsius}; and also with \ch{H2} plasma.
		However, we found that most \nds treated in this way only showed luminescence which immediatly bleached when illuminated with a cw \SI{660}{nm} laser even at low excitation powers of \SI{200}{\micro\watt}, or no luminescence at all.
		We double-checked with a CCD-image of the surface to be sure that there are \nds in the focus.
		This bleaching occured so quickly, that after a scanning no spectrum could be taken.
		The only samples which did yield spectra with measureable \ZPLs were the ones treated with \ch{H2}.
		However, also these \sivs were not single ones.
		Therefore, we did not further investigate these samples.
		\\
		% C-Schalen
		One sample showed shells around the \nd after oxidizing in air.
		We attribute this effect to a contamination in the oven.
		When we illuminated these \nds in the SEM for several moments, the shell went away.
		We therefore deducted that the shell is organic material.
		To get rid of the shells on the whole sample, we treated it with oxygen-argon plasma for \SI{3}{min}\footnote{Treatment performed by \schmauch}.
		After the first treatment, the shells were smaller, but not gone.
		So we put them into the oxygen-argon plasma again for \SI{3}{min}, however, the shells were bigger than before any treatment.
		We tried another approach to get rid of the shells with ozon treatment for \SI{4}{\hour} at \SI{360}{\celsius}.
		Before ozon treatment there the diamond Raman line and other Raman lines visible.
		After surface treatement, more lines appeared and all of these other lines got more intense.
		There are probably organic contaminations on the sample in which functional groups got introduced by the ozon treatment.
		We did not further investige this sample and defined it as broken.

		Raman spectroscopy of various samples gives insight to crystal quality and surface contamination.
		Raman scattering is the inelastic scattering of a photon $\hbar\omega_i$ on a molecule or crystal lattice in the initial state $\ket{i}$ with energy $E_i$.
		The molecule of cristal transitions into a higher energy state $E_f$ and the scattered photon with frequency $\omega_s$ looses the energy $\Delta E = E_f - E_i = \hbar(\omega_i-\omega_s)$.
		Therefore, energy from is exchanged between the photon and the excited matter, changing the rotational or oscillation energy of the involved molecule or the oscillation energy, i.e. phonons of the crystal lattice.
		The Raman shift is typically referenced in wavenumbers.
		It is calculated by:
		\begin{equation}
			\Delta \omega = \left( \frac{1}{\lambda_{ex}}-\frac{1}{\lambda_R}\right)
		\end{equation}
		As every solid exhibits characteristic phonon modes, Raman spectroscpy is used to identify the contributing elements of  a solid, hence in our case determine the purity of the diamond and identify contamination with sp$^2$ bonded and amorphous carbon, and graphite.
		Also, the Raman spectrum changes under the influence of stress in the sample, providing a way to investigate the stress in the sample with opical means.

		Raman measurements of the wet-milled \nds give insight to the issues of surface contamination, defects in the diamond lattice and strain in the lattice:
		Surface contamination like graphite and amorphous sp$^2$ hybridized carbon atoms cause additional peaks in the Raman spectrum.
		A high defect concentration may lead to both additional peaks, to a broadening of the first order Raman peak and a shift to smaller wavenumbers.
		Strain in the diamond broadens the first order Raman peak and causes a shift to higher wavenumbers \cite{Zaitsev2001,Prawer2004,Orwa2000}.
		\\
		For the Raman measurements the same layout of the setup described in \autoref{ch::confocal_setup} is used.
		As excitation lightsource, a \SI{532}{nm} continuous wave diode laser is used (IO \todo[fancyline]{type}).
		It provides single (frequency) mode laser light, which is a prerequisite for Raman investigations.
		The beamsplitter is a dichroic mirror (DRLP645), the laser light is additionally filtered out with a 532 Notch filter in the detection path in front of the single mode fiber instead of the otherwise used longpass filter.
		With these adaptions, the combination of the confocal unit and the spectrometer serve as a Raman spectrometer.
		As the diamond Raman line is very narrow (~xx\todo[fancyline]{check number}), the \SI[per-mode=symbol]{600}{\lines\per\mm} grating is used for a first overview; for more detailed measurements the \SI[per-mode=symbol]{1200}{\lines\per\mm} and \SI[per-mode=symbol]{1800}{\lines\per\mm} gratings are used.
		\\
		Due to the low signal from a single \nd, the Raman measurements are carried out at several areas on the sample \insituS which are densely covered with \nds, hence taking measurements of clusters of \nds.
		The narrow peak in \autoref{subfig::raman_no} corresponds to the first order diamond Raman peak.
		The Raman shift of \SI{1338}{\per\centi\meter} compared to the literature value of \SI{1332}{\per\centi\meter} of pristine diamond \cite{Zaitsev2001} indicates the presence of strain in the diamond particles.
		Furthermore, the investigated Raman spectra show a broad peak with a Raman shift of about \SI{1582}{\per\centi\meter} (\autoref{subfig::raman_no}).
		This shift corresponds to the G-band due to amorphous sp$^2$ hybridized carbon atoms and graphite.
		The exact G-band position and \lw is sensitive to parameters such as the clustering of the sp$^2$ phase, bond-length and bond-angle disorder, presence of sp$^2$ rings or chains, and the sp$^2$/sp$^3$ ratio \cite{Ferrari2004}.
		\\
		\Nd Raman spectra are considerably modified after \ox in air at \SI{450}{\degreeCelsius}.
		To verify this, we perform Raman measurements on three different spots on a non-oxidized sample (\insituS), and for comparison on three different spots on a sample produced in the same process which is additionally oxidized.
		While the G-band peak is present in every measurement performed on the sample which was not oxidized, it is not present in any of the measurements performed after \ox (\autoref{subfig::raman_ox}), indicating successful removal of sp$^2$ hybridized carbon and surface graphite.
		The position of the diamond Raman peak is the same oxidized (\insituSo) and non-oxidized (\insituSn) samples, indicating no effect on strain in the diamond.
		On the other hand, the width of the diamond Raman peak is between \SIlist{15; 30}{\per\centi\meter} without \ox treatment, but is only \SIrange{9}{11}{\per\centi\meter} after the \ox process.
		A possible reason for a change of the width is improved crystal quality.
		This effect is also subject in the following paragraphs and will be explained in more detail there.
		\\
		For comparison, measurements of the Raman line were also carried out on the implanted sample \implantedTao.
		These diamond particles are big enough to perform measurements on single \nds.
		We found one diamond Raman line at \SI[separate-uncertainty]{1308+-5}{\per\centi\meter}, one at \SI[separate-uncertainty]{1345+-5}{\per\centi\meter} and one at \SI[separate-uncertainty]{1348+-5}{\per\centi\meter} (given uncertainties are governed by spectrometer resolution).
		We have to distinguish two cases, a shift of the first order Raman line to higher versus lower wavenumbers than the first order Raman line of \SI{1332}{\per\centi\meter} in pristine diamond.
		\\
		As mentioned before, a Raman shift of the first order Raman line to lower wavenumbers and a broadening of the Raman line indicates defects in the diamond lattice \cite{Prawer2004}.
		The Raman line at \SI[separate-uncertainty]{1308+-5}{\per\centi\meter} exhibits a broad \lw of \SI[separate-uncertainty]{25+-5}{\per\centi\meter}.
		Therefore both the position and the \lw of the Raman line indicate that there are many defects present in the diamond.
		\\
		The other case is a shift of the first order Raman line towards higher wavenumbers.
		The shift of the first order Raman line to higher wavenumbers is attributed to strain in the diamond lattice.
		While under hydrostatic pressure, the triply degenerate first order Raman peak remains degenerate, under uniaxial and more complex stress configurations (biaxial stress, shear stress etc.) mode splitting occurs \cite{Prawer2004}.
		As the measured peaks at wavenumbers higher than the wavenumber in pristine diamond are broad, we attribute these peaks to stress configurations other than hydrostatic stress, where the mode splitting manifests itself in a broadening of the peak due to limited spectrometer resolution.
		\\
		To summarize, there are two cases, one where the first order Raman line hints at many defects present in the diamond lattice and the other that leads to the assumption that the stress configuration in the diamonds are uniaxial or more complicated stress configurations.
		In \autoref{subsec::spectra} we will show that both of these assumptions are consistent with the results from the measured \pl spectra.

		Transmission electron microscopy (\TEM, also sometimes conventional transmission electron microscopy or CTEM) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than \SI{100}{\nm} thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen.
		During \tem a beam of electrons is transmitted through a sample, forming an image of the transmitted sample.
		Since electrons have higher de Broglie wavelengths than photons, a higher resolution is obtainable, allowing the surface of \nds to be resolved. Thus, the crystallinity of single \nds can be studied directly.

		Using the sample \insituH, \TEM were performed by \schmauch.
		Smaller \nds would have been too small for the carbon grid which severs as a sample holder in the \TEM, and might have fallen through the grid and bigger bigger particles would have been too big to be transmitted by the electron beam, making the imaging impossible.
		In \autoref{fig::tem} there are \TEM images, one of them exhibits a single diamond particle and the other is a close-up image of a crystal boundary.
		From \autoref{subfig::tem_crystal} it can be seen that the diamond particle contains several crystallites and crystal boundaries.
		The edges of the cristallites are the sharp features within the diamond particle, the crystal boundaries the smoother features\todo{eher nur vermutung}.
		In \autoref{subfig::tem_boundary} the crystal layers which are more or less horizontal and in more or less the middle of the picture there is a vertical line which is the edge of a crystallite.
		So it is clear that the investigated sample does not contain beautiful single crystal diamond particles, which means a reduction of the crystal quality of the diamond particles.
