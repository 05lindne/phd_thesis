	% \epigraph{``Diamond forms under high temperature and pressure conditions that exist only about 100 miles beneath the earth's surface.''}{\textup{Gemological Institute of America Inc.}}

	Due to its extraordinary properties, diamond has transcended its sole purpose as a rare gem and developed into an important tool enabling various applications in industry and research. This change has been driven largely by the development of methods allowing to cheaply produce synthetic diamond. While synthetic diamonds are typically small and without the splendor generally associated with diamond, they can be produced on-demand and are thus arguably more useful than rare gemstones.
	In this chapter we introduce the two most common methods for the fabrication of diamonds in a laboratory setting: The \hpht and the \cvd method.
	The aptly named \hpht (\HPHT) process mimics the conditions under which diamond is formed in nature and is widely used to synthetically produce diamonds for industrial applications such as utilization of diamond as a abrasive.
	While \HPHT diamonds are utilized in this work, most reported measurements are based on diamond produced with the \CVD method in which diamonds are grown using a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Both processes have in common that defects and impurities are a naturally occurring.
	For a more extensive list of diamond production processes refer to \cite{davis1993diamond}.
	In the context of this thesis nano-sized diamonds are required. They can be obtained by milling larger sized \HPHT or \CVD diamonds down to the desired grain size in a vibrational mill.
	The obtained \nds are small enough that individual specimen have a chance of hosting a singleton \siv. These can be identified and used for further exploration.

\section[HPHT]{High-Pressure High-Temperature Diamond}\label{sec::hpht}

	The \HPHT method was the first process to successfully synthesize diamond in 1879.
	Today, it is still widely used due to its relatively cheap production costs for small diamonds.
	\\
	In the \HPHT process, diamond is synthesized from graphite under temperatures of up to \SI{1.5d3}{\celsius} pressures between \SI{5d4}{bar} and \SI{d6}{bar} \cite{davis1993diamond}. Under these extreme conditions, carbon transitions from its graphite to its diamond phase because the latter becomes energetically favorable \cite{liander1955artificial, bundy1955man, bovenkerk1993errors, bovenkerk1959preparation}.
	The machine used for this kind of synthesis is a press.
	For some forms of this method, a metallic catalyst solvent is added lowering the required pressures and temperatures by causing graphite to dissolve earlier. At the same the catalyst promotes the crystallization process.
	Several press designs exist, all of which relying on creating and maintaining high pressures and a high temperatures.
	While it is possible to grow big ($> \SI{10}{\carat}$) high-quality diamonds with the \HPHT process, its cost quickly increases and thus becomes unfavorable.
	\\
	In this thesis, \HPHT \nds diamonds produced by Davydov et al. \cite{Davydov2014} are spectroscopically investigated.

\section[CVD]{Chemical Vapor Deposition Diamond}\label{sec::cvd}

	In contrast to the \HPHT method, diamond is crystallized from carbon available in the gas phase in the \CVD method.
	The process still requires respectable temperatures in the range of \SIrange{700}{1300}{\celsius} but makes due with the low pressures of less than \SI{1}{\bar} available in a vacuum growth chamber \cite{schwander2011review}.
	\\
	The chamber contains a vapor consisting of a mixture of atomic hydrogen and methane. The gas can be forced into the plasma phase using strong microwaves or hot filaments \cite{balmer2009chemical, ferro2002synthesis, koizumi2008physics}. While the hot filament is easy to implement, it has the disadvantage that atoms which are etched from the filament during the growth process are likely to contaminate the diamond. To minimize the introduction of defects other than \sivs in the diamond, growing diamonds in a microwave plasma is preferred. In it methane molecules dissociate and relase carbon. In the presence of a substrate such as \ir containing suitable seeds, carbon can crystallize forming diamond. \Fref{fig::cvd_sketch} illustrates the setup. In a plasma containing atomic hydrogen, the formation of diamond is favored over the formation of graphite. This is due to the fact that the atomic hydrogen preferentially etches sp$^2$ bonded carbon, i.e.\ graphite.

	\begin{figure}[!htp]

		\label{fig::cvd_sketch}
	\end{figure}

	Typically, single crystal diamond substrates are required to grow single crystal diamond. \HPHT substrates are suitable to start a crystallization process. This approach is referred to as homoepitaxial growth. An alternative approach is to utilize non-diamond substrates such as \ir or platinum to trigger heteroepitaxial growth \cite{tachibana2001growth, lin1994local}.
	This method is utilized for all the \CVD \nds grown and investigated in this thesis.
	It relies on small diamond crystals deposited in the substrate acting as seeds for the diamond crystallization process\footnote{\CVD \nd growth performed by \gsell}. Seed diamond crystals are commercially available, and are usually particles produced by a so-called detonation process.
	In a detonation process, the high pressure produced by shock-waves of a detonation is used to create very small diamond particles of a size down to a few nanometers.
	
	Growth on a substrate is favored, if the lattice constant of the substrate and the diamond to be grown are similar.
	The lattice constant of \ir is \SI{0.384}{nm} \cite{Arblaster2010,Gsell2007} and thus close to the lattice constant of diamond with \SI{0.356}{nm} \cite{davis1993diamond}.
	Therefore, the diamond was grown on a stratified substrate topped with an \ir layer of \SIrange{60}{150}{nm} thickness\footnote{Production of the stratified substrate performed by \gsell}.
	The \ir layers themselves were grown onto an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) buffer layer, which in turn was grown on a silicon wafer \cite{Gsell2004a}.
	If the lattice constant of the substrate and the diamond are not matched, stress in the diamond lattice is induced.
	Therefore, the \ir substrate not only facilitates diamond growth, but also reduces unfavorable stress in the \nds. The detrimental effects of stress on the diamond lattice and its implications with respect to hosted \sivs are briefly discussed in \Fref{ch::distribution}.

	To produce \nds of controlled size, the growth process is stopped when the diamonds grown onto the seed crystals are large enough.
	If the growth process is continued, the individual crystals grow together to form diamond films.
	Such diamond films are used as starting material for the wet-milling process described in \Fref{sec::wet_milled_nds}.
	\\
	One of the advantages of the \CVD process is that \si is incorporated automatically into diamonds, \sivs can thus be formed \textit{in-situ} as the diamond is grown. The presence of \si atoms required to be absorbed into the diamond lattice is explained by the plasma etching the edges of the \si waver underneath the growth substrate.
	To further increase the \si content in the chamber, sacrificial \si can be introduced.
	\\
	After \nd growth, the \nds are either investigated directly on the growth substrate or transferred to an ultrasonic bath to obtain a solution which is coated onto other substrates for further exploration.
	\\
	In this thesis, two types of \nds samples were investigated.
	The first batch, henceforth referred to as \CVD samples, was grown by the group of \schreck using detonation diamond seeds of a size smaller than \SI{3}{nm}(produced by the company Microdiamant, product Liquid Diamond mono-crystalline, MSY {0-0.03} micron GAF).
	For the growth process, \SI{1}{\percent} of methane was added to the hydrogen environment in the growth chamber.
	The growth process was performed with a pressure of \SI{30}{hPa} for \SIrange{30}{60}{min}, yielding \nds of a diameter of about \SIrange{100}{200}{nm}. A sample of the produced diamonds is given in \Fref{fig::sem_cvd}.

		\label{fig::sem_cvd}
	\end{figure}

	The second type of samples consist of \CVD \nds grown onto molecular analogs of diamond crystals.
	A subgroup of these molecular diamonds are called diamondoids and are carbon crystals based on the carbon cage molecule adamantane \ch{C10H16}.
	The molecular diamonds used for this work are adamantane in cyclohexane, mercapto adamantane in cyclohexane, and cyclohexane.
	Each of these seed crystals was used in different growth processes.
	During the growth process, either \SI{1}{\percent} or \SI{3}{\percent} methane was added to the hydrogen plasma and either \si (\ch{Si}) or \si dioxide (\ch{SiO2}) was injected to promote the formation of \textit{in-situ} incorporated \sivs, see \Fref{tab::diamondiods}.

\section[Wet-Milling]{Wet-Milled Nanodiamonds}\label{sec::wet_milled_nds}


	In addition to growing \nds of a specific size directly via a \CVD process, macroscopic diamond starting material can be crushed to obtain small diamond particles.
	In contrast to \nds directly grown by a \CVD process, the process is divided into two sub-processes:
	At first a macroscopic diamond is produced using one of the methods introduced in this chapter.
	Then macroscopic diamond is continuously milled into smaller diamond particles.
	\\
	The wet-milled \nds investigated in this thesis were kindly provided by \muzha. During the wet-milling process small metal beeds in an aqueous solution are driven by the vibrations of a vibrational mill.
	The moving beads continuously collide with the present diamonds and thus keep breaking them into smaller and smaller particles.
	A sketch of the process is shown in \Fref{fig::sketch_milling}. Steel contamination introduced by the beads can be eliminated in a post-processing treatment with acid.

	\begin{figure}[!htb]

		\testbox{\includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0,  clip= true, width = 0.6\textwidth]{./pics/milling_sketch.pdf}}
		\caption[Wet-milling in a vibrational mill]{Sketch of a wet-milling process in a vibrational mill. A macroscopic polycrystalline \nd is progressively broken down into smaller polycrystalline \nds by metal beads.}\label{fig::sketch_milling}
	\end{figure}

	The big advantage of the milling process is that it enables the production of a large quantity of diamond nano-particles.
	When producing \nds directly via a \CVD process, the number of produced \nds in one process scales with the surface of the substrate on which the \nds are grown.
	In contrast, the quantity of milled \nds scales with the volume of the starting material.
	Another advantage of the wet-milling process is that the \nds are already in an aqueous solution after milling.
	Therefore, it it can be used to spin-coat the \nds directly onto any substrate. Samples created in this fashion can directly be used for further investigation and do not require additional processing.
	\\
	If the starting material for the wet-milling process is a polycrystalline diamond film, it is likely to break along distinct crystal boundaries.
	However, due to imperfections in the growth process, particles may break down such that progressively smaller milled diamond grain remain polycrystalline.
	As a result, the final \nds contain crystal boundaries themselves, indicative of reduced crystal quality.
	To improve diamond quality \nds are treated with post-processing steps including annealing in vacuum and oxidation in air.
	A detailed description of these processes and their effects is given in \Fref{ch::crystal_quality}.
	\\
	In general any diamond, independent of production method, can be used as starting material for the milling process.
	In the following sections, available samples are distinguished by the respective staring material and milling method.

	\subsection{Wet-Milled \HPHT \Nds}\label{subsec::milled_hpht_nds}
		We investigated \nds wet-milled from a \HPHT starting material to median sizes of about \SIlist{45;80;260}{nm}.
		They were then drop-cast onto an \ir substrate and implanted with \ch{^{28}Si^1+} \todo[fancyline]{Complete implantation parameters}. The implantation itself was performed by \rogalla.
		% After impalntation, the \nds of a size of \SI{80}{nm} (sample \hphtimpeighty) were annealed in vacuum for \SI{1}{\hour} at \SI{1000}{\celsius}, \SI{900}{\celsius} for \SI{3}{\hour}.
		All \HPHT \nds were oxidized in air at \SI{450}{\celsius} for \SI{3}{\hour}. Resulting samples available for explorations are designated \hphtimpfortyfive, \hphtimpeighty, \hphtimptwosixty and listed in \Fref{tab::samplenames}.

	\subsection{Wet-Milled \CVD \Nds}\label{subsec::milled_nds}
		% - milled CVD diamond film (in-situ SiV)

		In the following paragraphs, details of the production processes of \nd produced by wet-milling a \CVD diamond film in a vibrational mill are given.
		For an overview of the samples refer to \Fref{tab::samplenames}.
		The starting material for the wet-milled \nds was a nano-crystalline diamond film \cite{Williams2006a} directly grown on a silicon wafer by \CVD.
		A microwave hydrogen plasma containing \SI{1}{\percent} methane was used to grow on purified \SI{5}{\nano\meter} \nd seeds (produced by PlasmaChem).
		To induce \textit{in-situ} \siv creation, sacrificial \Si pieces are placed in the growth chamber.
		During diamond growth the \si pieces are etched by the plasma leading to individual atoms being incorporated into the diamond lattice.
		The diamond film is then wet-milled in a vibrational mill with steel beads.
		The high amount of steel containment due to the steel beads is removed by extensive acid treatment.
		We also investigated \nds milled with silicon nitride beads, and found that the choice of material of the beads does not result in any noticeable difference in dependent measurements.
		The median diameters of the diamonds are \SIlist{50; 70; 100}{\nano\meter} as determined by laser diffraction spectroscopy. \Fref{fig::sem_milled} shows milled \nds on-top of an \ir substrate.

		\begin{figure}[!htb]

			 \label{fig::sem_milled}
		\end{figure}

		The aqueous solution containing the \nds is drop cast onto an \ir film on a \Si substrate.
		The \ir film of a thickness of \SI{130}{nm} is grown onto a buffer layer of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which in turn is grown onto a \Si wafer.
		The \ir surface has the advantage that it acts as an antenna and therefore enhances the collection efficiency of fluorescence light \cite{Neu2012a}. For a discussion on the properties of the substrate see \Fref{sec::ir_substrate}.
		Post-procession treatment consist of annealing in vacuum at \SI{900}{\degreeCelsius} or consecutive \ox in air at a temperature of \SI{450}{\degreeCelsius}, or a combination of the two.
		The duration for either treatment method was \SIrange{3}{6}{\hour}.

	\subsection{Doubly Wet-Milled Implanted \Nds Implanted With \Si}\label{subsec::2_milled_nds}
		% - 2x vermahlene, implantierte NDs (E6->MDs->NDs)

		In addition to \sivs that were implanted during diamond growth, we investigated \nds with \sivs implanted after diamond growth.
		% Here a polycristalline Element Six diamond film (electronic grade) served as starting material.
		We developed a procedure composed of consecutive milling steps to obtain \nds with an optimal concentration and inhomogeneous distribution of \sivs in the host \nds.
		A suboptimal concentration of \sivs in \nds arises from the fact, that \si implantation causes the \sivs to form in a specific depth dependent on the implantation energy\todo{ergebnisse von simulationen einfuegen}.
		As a consequence, when implanting bulk material most of the diamond is left vacant of \sivs.
		Hence, a big portion of \nds milled from such a bulk material would not host any \sivs.
		\\
		To obtain diamond particles with a homogeneous distribution of \sivs, the process of fabricating implanted \nds is the following:
		First, a polycrystalline diamond film (produced by Element Six, electronic grade) is milled to diamond particles a few microns in size.
		Next, these micro-diamonds are spin-coated onto \ir substrates and implanted with \ch{^{28}Si^1+}.
		To eliminate lattice damage and unnecessary vacancies resulting from the implantation process, diamonds were annealed in vacuum and subsequently oxidized.
		At last, the micrometer sized diamond particles are milled to the desired smaller sizes.
		\\
		For the milling process in a vibrational mill, a minimum amount of diamond material is necessary\todo{how much?}.
		When starting with a diamond film, this threshold is easily reached, however, a big quantity of micro-diamonds is needed to meet the requirements.
		To develop an optimal production procedure of implanted \nds, we first ran preliminary tests with a small amount of diamond material.
		After determination of the optimal specifications of the procedure, we began production on a larger scale.
		\\
		For our first experiments, we coated a small amount of micro-diamonds milled from the diamond film onto a \si substrate without an \ir layer.
		The micro-diamonds were then implanted with \ch{^{28}Si^1+} at an implantation energy of \SI{1.7}{MeV}, and fluences of \SIrange{e9}{e12}{cm^-1}\footnote{Implantation performed by \rogalla.}.
		After implantation, the micro-diamonds on the \si substrate were annealed for \SI{2}{\hour} at \SI{900}{\celsius} and subsequently oxidized in air for \SI{2}{\hour} at \SI{450}{\celsius}. For a detailed explanation of the effect of annealing and oxidation refer to \Fref{subsec::ann_ox}.
		Using this procedure, we encountered the problem that the \si from the substrate sublimated and re-nucleated during annealing.
		This process caused the diamonds to sink into the \si surface, see \Fref{subfig::sunken_nd}.
		\\
		\Ir is less prone to damage by high temperatures and withstands annealing procedures up to our standard annealing temperature of \SI{900}{\celsius} without problems.
		Hence, we repeated the production process in the same manner as described above, but this time, we used an \ir coated \si wafer as substrate.
		Thus we effectively circumvented the reported problems of micro-diamonds sinking into the substrate surface.
		\\
		A further technical challenge was the limited space in the vacuum oven used for annealing the micro-diamonds.
		This circumstance capped the size of individual substrates for the micro-diamonds to a side length of \SI{2}{cm}.

It can be seen, that the micro-diamonds exhibit sizes of a few micrometer.}
		\end{figure}

		Spectroscopic measurements revealed, that micro-diamonds implanted with a fluence of \SI{e11}{\per\centi\meter\squared} were best suited to form a high concentration of \sivs within the micro-diamonds.
		\\
		Following our results from the preliminary tests, we initiated mass production.
		The micro-diamonds were directly spin-coated onto $20$ \ir substrates of a side length of \SI{2}{cm} which yielded densely coated samples, see \Fref{subfig::microdiamonds}.
		After spin-coating the samples were implanted with \ch{^{28}Si^1+} using an implantation energy of \SI{900}{keV} with a fluence of \SI{e11}{\per\centi\meter\squared}\footnote{Implantation performed by \klug.}.
		The micro-diamonds were then annealed in vacuum for \SI{3}{\hour} at \SI{900}{\celsius} and oxidized in air for \SI{3}{\hour} at \SI{450}{\celsius}.
		As mentioned, a bottleneck of the production was the limited space of the vacuum oven.
		Only $3$ samples fit into it at once, hence it was necessary to recursively repeat the annealing process until all samples were annealed.
		\\
		At last, the micro-diamonds were milled again to sizes of about \SIlist{40;45;240;260}{nm}.
		The diamonds of sizes \SIlist{40;240}{nm} were directly annealed in vacuum at \SI{1200}{\celsius}\todo{time?}\footnote{performed by \muzha} without prior spin-coating.

\section{\Ir Substrate}\label{sec::ir_substrate}

	As mentioned in \Fref{sec::cvd}, growth on a substrate is favored, if the lattice constants of substrate and diamond to be grown are similar.
	Therefore, for \CVD nanodiamond growth a multi-layered substrate was prepared in a heteroepitaxial growth process.
	This substrate consists of a \si wafer on the bottom, a yttria-stabilized zirconia buffer layer in the middle and an \ir layer on top.
	Initially, whole \SI{4}{\inch} wafers were prepared with a multi-layered structure.
	After the heteroepitaxial growth processes, the wafer is cut to squares with a side length of \SI{1}{cm} to fit into all machinery used during experiments, such as the spin-coater, the confocal setup, the \fib and the SEM.
	\\
	Apart from the favorable lattice constant, \ir exhibits further advantages which lead us to coating the wet-milled diamonds onto these same multi-layered substrates:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The high hydrophilicity of \ir enhances the homogeneity of the \nds on the substrate after spin-coating or drop-casting. Hydrophilicity is further improved by treating the substrate in a Piranha etch (50:50 mixture of sulfuric acid \ch{H2So4} and hydrogen peroxide (\ch{H2O2}) by removing oxide layers on the surface.
		The treatment with Piranha etch also has the advantage that all organic contamination is removed.
		Measurements after applying the Piranha cleaning yielded an estimation of the contact angle of slightly more than one degree.
		To determine the contact angle with water, the volume of a water drop is compared to the surface it covers after dropping it onto an \ir substrate, see \Fref{subfig::wetting}. From that an estimation of the contact angle is deduced.
		\item During the post-processing steps, it is of major importance, that the substrate can withstand high temperatures.
		We remark that during the preliminary tests with implanted \nds on a \si substrate we encountered difficulties with diamonds on a \si substrate as the sunk into the surface after annealing.
		In contrast, \ir withstands the high temperatures required for annealing without damage.
		\item \Ir acts both as a mirror and as an antenna for the \fl light emitted by the \siv \cite{Neu2012a}.
		Therefore, the collection efficiency of the \fl light is enhanced.
	\end{itemize}

		\label{fig::sem_substrates}
	\end{figure}

	At this point we comment upon a minor complication we experienced when using \ir surfaces.
	If the \ir layer is too thin, it tends to peel off the substrate, see \Fref{subfig::peeled_ir}.
	We encountered this problem during a cleaning procedure in the ultrasonic bath.
	However, this disadvantage is trivially circumvented by using a thicker \ir layer.
	For our measurements, we used an \ir layer of a thickness of \SI{130}{nm}, for which we did not encounter any adhesion problems.

	\newpage
	\subsection{Substrate Preparation}

		Prior to drop-casting or spin-coating a diamond solution onto the \ir substrate, the substrate is cleaned.
		The standard cleaning procedure is started with treating the substrate in diverse chemicals in an ultrasonic bath.
		Each step is carried out for a duration of \SIrange{3}{7}{\minute}, approximately adjusted to the amount of contamination present:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Distilled water with a drop of dishwasher detergent: Removes coarse contamination off the substrate.
			\item Isopropanol (purity \SI{99.9}{\percent} p.a.): Dissolves oils without leaving oil traces as compared to ethanol.
			\item Acetone (purity \SI{99.9}{\percent} p.a.): A heavy-duty degreasing agent, also dissolves many plastics.
			\item Distilled water: Acetone heavily reacts with the later applied Piranha solution, potentially causing explosions. Therefore, any acetone residue has to be removed. As acetone is water-soluble, distilled water is used to remove the residue.
		\end{itemize}

		Thereafter, the substrates are put into a Piranha solution (\SI{50}{\percent} sulfuric acid \ch{H2So4}, \SI{50}{\percent} hydrogen peroxide \ch{H2O2}) to enhance the surface hydrophilicity and therefore obtain a homogeneous distribution of diamonds on the surface.
		They are then put again into distilled water and blow-dried with compressed air to avoid residue from the water.

		The substrates were then either drop-casted or spin-coated with aqueous diamond solutions.
		For the former, the substrates are heated on a heating plate to a temperature of \SI{60}{\celsius}.
		While the substrates are permanently heated by the heating plate, drops of a volume of about \SI{5}{\micro\liter} are dropped onto the substrate surface.
		If substantially more than \SI{5}{\micro\liter} is needed, then several drops of about \SI{5}{\micro\liter} are dropped onto the substrate consecutively. A single large drop is ill-advised since the solution would flow off the substrate before drying.

		For spin-coating, an on-site built spin coater was used.
		Therefore the spin-coater is preset to velocity of \SI{2500}{\rpm}.
		Then drops of \SI{5}{\micro\liter} are dropped on the substrate and the spin-coater is immediately turned on.
		After about \SI{3}{\minute}, the drop has dried.
		If more than \SI{5}{\micro\liter} of diamond solution is wanted, the spin-coating is repeated until the desired amount is reached.

				 \caption[Listing of investigated wet-milled samples]{Listing of investigated wet-milled samples. While this is a subset of all the samples investigated throughout the work of this thesis, these samples are the most thoroughly investigated ones. They are the basis for the results reported in \Fref{ch::distribution}. The first column indicates the names of the samples, the second the mean diameter of the \nds, and the third designates how the \si was incorporated into the diamond.} \label{tab::samplenames}
