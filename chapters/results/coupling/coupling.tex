\chapter[Coupling NDs]{Coupling \Nds to Photonic Structures}	\label{ch::coupling}

	In the last chapter, we saw that the spectroscopic properties of \sivs vary strongly among individual \nds.
	\Nds are further implemented in photonic structures for the application in metrology as well as in quantum cryptography or quantum computing.
	Therefore, it is important to have a good knowledge of the spectroscopic properties of the individual \todo{think of other word} \siv.
	A preselection of \nds including an \siv with desired properties is performed.
	The selected \nd is then transferred to target structures.
	In the scope of this thesis, \nds including \sivs were coupled to two different kinds of structures:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \Vcsels: The aim is to create a hybrid-integrated \sps, where an electric current is employed to create single photons. The diamond containing an \siv is placed directly on the beam output. Hence the \siv is directly pumped by the laser beam. This system is interesting for metrological applications, as it is the major building block for a portable device ready to calibrate single photon detectors.
		\item Plasmonic Nanoantennas: The aim is to enhance \pl intensity. As described in previous chapters, not only \ZPL position and \lw, but also the \pl intensity varies strongly among individual \sivs. However, in metrology a photon flux rate high enough to be measured by a low optical flux detector is needed \cite{Vaigu2017}. This increase in intensity is achieved by coupling the \sivs in \nds to plasmonic antennas.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Additional Experimental Methods}


	To couple \nds to photonic structures, we pursued several different methods: 
	\begin{enumerate} 
		\item Directly spin-coat the structures with a \nd solution and consecutively look for a structure containing a \nds with an \siv exhibiting the desired spectroscopic properties. This method was tried with the antenna structures, as there are many antenna structures on one substrate (see \Cref{subfig::antenna_structures_sem}), therefore there is a chance that a suited \nd is incidentally ends up at the right spot. However, it is not suitable for the VCSELs, first because of the morphology of the VCSELs and secondly, because there is a very limited number of VCSELs on one substrate.
		\item \label{item::pp}Use an \ir substrate covered with \nds containing \sivs, look for a suited \nd and transfer it with a \pp technique using a nanomanipulator. The nanomanipulator is essentially a thin tip in a \sem. The \ir substrate is prepeocessed with markers, to record the position of the preselected \nd. The huge advantage is that the very best suited \nd can be preselected. However, disadvantages of this process include the electron radiation during the \pp process, which might affect \siv \fl and the further restriction that the \nds must be big enough to be picked up with the nanomanipulator. 
		\item Similar to method \ref{item::pp}, however the transfer is performed with an \afm. While this method has the advantage that the \nds are not irradiated with electrons, the disavantage is that it is not possible to  observe the picking process in real time. The area of the preselected \nd has to be scanned after every pick-up try, which is very time consuming and therefore was not further pursued after some trials.
	\end{enumerate}

	In the following paragraphs, the \pp technique of method \ref{item::pp} is described in more detail.
	It is the coupling method most extensivly deployed in the scope of this thesis and requires a range of experimental setups. 
	The \pp process was carried out with major help from \pauly.
	The nanomanipulator setup was provided by the same group.

	In general, nanomanipulator is a tip mounted inside an SEM.
	The one used for our experiments was built by the company Kleindiek (model MM3A-EM) and has a changeable tungsten tip (see \cref{subfig::nanomanipulator_image}).
	It is mouted inside a Thermo Scientific\texttrademark{} Helios NanoLab\texttrademark{}  DualBeam\texttrademark{} microscope, which combines a \fib and an electron microscope.
	The bent nanomanipulator tip has 3 degrees of freedom: up/down and left/right both in an arc up to \SI{240}{\degree} and \SI{12}{\milli\metre} in/out (see arrows in \cref{subfig::nanomanipulator_image}). 
	Before nanomanipulation the tip was "sharpened" with the focussed ion beam by etching away  tungsten with gallium ions.
	This sharpening was performed to meet the size criteria necessary to pick up the \nds.
	In \cref{subfig::nanomanipulator_tip} the sharpened tip is shown.
	The small tip sticking out of the bigger cone is the sharp tip used for \pp.

	\end{figure}

	An \nd pre-characterized in the confocal setup exhibiting the preferred optical properties (e.g. narrow linewidth, high count rate) has to be found again in the SEM setup where the nanomanipulator is installed.
	Therefore, we milled cross markers into the \ir coating of the \si substrate using the \fib prior to spin-coating the substrate with \nd solution.\todo{fib parameter}
	The crosses' size is \num{10}$\times$\SI{10}{\micro\meter\squared} are exhibit a nominal depth of \SI{40}{nm}.
	Four crosses are the cornerpoints of a \num{50}$\times$\SI{50}{\micro\meter\squared} sqaure.
	The \num{10}$\times$\num{10} crosses spaned one field of crosses; we usually put 3 fields of crosses on one substrate.
	\\
	To record the position of a \nd \wrt a cross marker, we used two different methods:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Scanning the sample in the confocal setup while a white light source illuminates the sample from the side in an acute angle. The edges of the cross markers are visible in the fluorescence scan. After turning the white light lamp off, the same area is scanned once more to record the fluorescence from the \sivs. An overlay of the two images identifies the position of flourescent \sivs \wrt the cross markers.\todo{put in a pic of whitelightscan} The disadvantage of this method is, that it takes a lot of time, as every scan has to be performed twice. Also, as only \fl scans are performed, no information of the \nds is accesessible, such as the size of the individual \nds or the distribution of the \nds. 
		\item The substrate was first scanned in a commercial \lsm \todo{specs}. The \lsm is a confocal microscope where the focus of a laser is used to obtain the height of a structure. \todo{verify info}It is possible to scan a whole field of cross markers in several minutes. The obtained image is a greyscale image, where the greyscale corresponds to the height deviation of a structure. Therefore, both the crosses and the \nds appear in darker shades of grey. So in contrast to the provious method, information on the \nds is accesessible. After scanning the substrate with the \lsm, it is put into the confocal setup. While observing the surface with the CCD camera, a specific cross marker is chosen as the starting point of a \fl scan. Comparing the \lsm image and a \fl scan, fluorescent dots of the \fl scan are attributed to \nds in the \lsm scan (see \cref{subfig::cross_laser_scan,subfig::pp_pl_scan}).
