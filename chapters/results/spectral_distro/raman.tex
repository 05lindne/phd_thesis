	\subsection{Raman Measurements} \label{subsec::raman}

	For the Raman measurements the same layout of the setup described in \Fref{ch::confocal_setup} is used.
	As excitation lightsource, a \SI{532}{nm} diode laser is used (IO \todo[fancyline]{type}).
	It provides single (frequency) mode laser light, which is a prerequisite for Raman investigations.
	The beamsplitter is a dichroic mirror (DRLP645\todo[fancyline]{type}), the laser light is additionally filtered out with a 532 Notch filter\todo[fancyline]{type} in the detection path in front of the single mode fiber instead of the otherwise used longpass filter.
	With these adaptions, the combination of the confocal unit and the spectrometer serve as a Raman spectrometer.
	As the diamond Raman line is very narrow (~xx\todo[fancyline]{check number}), the \SI[per-mode=symbol]{600}{\lines\per\mm} grating is used for a first overview; for more detailed measurements the \SI[per-mode=symbol]{1200}{\lines\per\mm} and \SI[per-mode=symbol]{1800}{\lines\per\mm} gratings are used.
