	\subsection{Sideband} \label{subsubsec::sideband}

		\todo{beginning new}As mentioned before, phonons of the diamond lattice and the color center manifenst themselves as peaks in the sideband of the \pl spectrum. 
		Phonons reduce the intensity of the the purely electronic transition, the \zpl.
		The electron-phonon coupling is quantified by the \db factor or the \hr. 
		The former is the integrated intensity of the \zpl $I_{ZPL}$ divided by the integrated intensity of the \pl of the whole spectrum, i.e. \ZPL plus sidebands, $I_{tot}$ \cite{Neu2014,Gaebel2004}.
		The \hr factor $S$ is defined as $I_{ZPL}/I_{tot}=\exp{-S}$.\todo{end new}

		From literature it is known, that the \siv in \nd exhibits a large \db of over 70\% \cite{Neu2011,Neu2011b}, which is consistent with our measurements of \emnarrow and \embroad.
		Nevertheless, sideband peaks are present in many \siv PL emission spectra.
		The investigated emitters exhibit two different structures of sideband spectra: The spectra in \gv exhibit one strong sideband peak (\autoref{fig::broad_peak_sb}), spectra in \gh exhibit several weaker sideband peaks.
		\\
		However, there is no recurring pattern in the sideband of \gh.
		The challenge arises to unequivocally distinguish between peaks stemming from a phonon sideband and peaks stemming from shifted, less intense \siv \ZPLs.
		The possibility exists, that some peaks identified as phonon sidebands are actually ZPLs stemming from shifted \sivs. 
		Therefore, we will focus our investigations on the more prominent sideband of \gv.
		\\
		Most of the spectra in \gv exhibit a characteristic shape, composed of the ZPL and one strong sideband peak which is mostly shifted \SIrange{37}{43}{meV}. 
		In reference \cite{Dietrich2014} the \SI{42}{meV} sideband peak is attributed to a non-localized (lattice) mode. 
		It is also stated, that the local vibrational mode at \SI{64}{meV} is much stronger than the  \SI{42}{meV} sideband peak. 
		While the peak attributed to the non-localized mode is very strong in our measurements, we cannot identify the peak attributed to the local vibrational \siv mode in the spectra of \gv. 
		A possible explanation is, that the lattice mode at \SIrange{37}{43}{meV} is so strong that the local vibrational mode at \SI{64}{meV} cannot be separated from the tail of the lattice mode.
		In \autoref{fig::sideband_fit} the distance between the \cwl of the sideband peak and the \cwl of the ZPL is plotted against the ZPL \cwl. 
		The distribution is fitted with a linear regression.
		We attribute the variance in the sideband shift to strain: \correct{Adam Galis Erkenntnisse}
		\\
		\todo{beginning new}For further investigations, we plotted the \ZPL  of \gv with multiple peaks. 
		We found that two Lorentzian fits fit the peak best.
		\autoref{fig::sideband_multfit} shows histograms of the distribution of the \cw and the \lw of the fitted peaks.
		Keep in mind that two of the peaks sum up to the peak visible as a \ZPL and the third peak is the sideband peak which we attribute to a lattice mode.
		We found that the \lw of the sideband peak exhibits values up to \SI{20}{nm}.
		This broad width is an indicator, that the local vibrational mode might indeed be outpowered by the more intense lattice mode.
		However, it is not very easy to find spectra where the sideband peak is pronounced and isolated enough to make proper statistics.
		The original \ZPL is split up in two peaks, one with a median \cwl of \SI{738}{nm} and a median \lw of \SI{4.5}{nm} and the other with a median \cwl of \SI{742}{nm} and a median \lw of \SI{8}{nm}.\todo{correct and verify all numbers}
		It could be that this is an indication for another sideband peak at \SI{742}{nm}.
		This assumption could be verified by cryostatic measurements, where the phonon sideband should vanish and only the \ZPL survive and split up into the four-level fine structure.

		We performed some cryostatic measurements to to pursue two goals:
		First, if we see the four-level splitting of the \ZPL this is further proof that the dominant peaks of our spectra are indeed all due to \sivs and do not stem from other impurities.
		Second, if the sideband peaks vanish at cold temperatures, this is evidence that they are caused by phonons.
		So we cooled down a sample, but all we saw was a wood of lines.
		Apparently, there were multiple \sivs in the \nds and they were all strained, messing up the four-level line structure.
