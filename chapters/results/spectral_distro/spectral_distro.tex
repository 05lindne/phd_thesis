\chapter[Spectral Distribution]{Spectral Distribution of \sivs in Nanodiamonds}	\label{ch::distribution}

	In this chapter we report our results regarding luminescence properties of \sivs. The samples used in our investigation consists of a large set of \CVD \nds containing \textit{in-situ} \sivs of a size in the range of \SIrange{70}{100}{\nm}. Throughout the chapter we refer to samples using their distinct sample-id as listed in \cref{}.

	The obtained fluorescence spectra of \sivs show that both the center wavelength of the \ZPL as well as the \lw of the \zpl vary significantly among different samples.
	Our measurements over a large set of \sivs indicate a strong correlation between the center wavelength of the \zpl and the corresponding \lws, resulting in a previously unreported bimodal distribution.
	We assert single photon emission from these \sivs across the whole range of \zpl positions and \lws.
	Furthermore we detect fluorescence intermittency, i.e.\ blinking. The obtained data for the bright and dark times indicate
	an exponential decay of the dark state and a log-normal decay of the bright state, the latter of which has to our knowledge not been reported as of yet.
