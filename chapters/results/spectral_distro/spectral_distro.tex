\chapter[Spectral Distribution]{Spectral Distribution of \sivs in Nanodiamonds}	\label{ch::distribution}


	In the following chapter, spectroscopic measurements of the \sivs are described.
	% Unless explicitly otherwise stated, the results in this paper report measurements of the milled nanodiamonds containing \textit{in-situ} incorporated \sivs.
	At first, a short introduction will be given.
	The additional theory, which goes beyond the scope of the explained theory in \autoref{ch::theory} and additional experimental equipment will be explained.
