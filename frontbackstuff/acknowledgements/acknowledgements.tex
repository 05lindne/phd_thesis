\section*{Acknowledgements}
	
	First of all, I want to thank my supervisor, Christoph Becher, for the opportunity of writing my PhD thesis performing research on the topic of quantum optics. 
	I owe him my utmost gratitude for his support in times when my mental health complicated the work on this thesis.

	I would like to offer my special thanks to Christophe Couteau, the second examiner of this thesis. 

	This work would not have been possible without the collaboration with the group of Anke Krueger, especially with Andreas Muzha, who performed the wet-milling. 
	This crucial step yielded the extensive data collection reported in this thesis.

	I cannot express in words how thankful I am for the help of Christoph Pauly, who is a master in performing tricky \pp processes. Without him, all \nds would probably still rest on their original substrate. 
	More often than not discussions with him yielded new ideas to tackle technical problems due to his background in material sciences.

	It was always interesting and fruitful to work with Nancy Rahbany on coupling \nds to the double bowtie antenna structures. 

	I wish to acknowledge the help of the group of Matthias Schreck and especially Stefan Gsell for providing this work both with CVD-grown \nds and with \ir coated substrates.

	I want to thank Adam Gali for providing the theoretical calculations which put our experimental results of the wavelength shift in an established context.

	I am happy to have had the opportunity to work in the SIQUTE and to experience an international exchange of ideas. I want to thank all affiliated people.

	I am very grateful for the guiding help of Janine Riedrich-MÃ¶ller, who was of guiding help during the start of my PhD and never tired of running downstairs to the lab to help me with peculiar problems of the setup. 
	Furthermore, I would also like to thank Christian Hepp and Carsten Arendt, for their help with technical challenges. 
	I want to express my special thanks to my office colleague Philipp Fuchs and lab colleague Alexander Bommer for sharing both fun moments and lousy moments.
	I also want to thank the whole Quantum Optics group for their support.

	I owe special thanks to Elke Huschens, who solved complex bureaucratic and organizational problems in the blink of an eye.

	I want to thank my friends near and far for cheerful and fulfilling times beyond physics. 

	I am grateful to my family for their support during my studies. I want to thank my sister for her moral support, my mum who kindled my diverse curiosity and my dad who introduced me to the great fascination of science and technology.
	
	Finally I want to thank my partner Michael for his never-ending support in very demanding times. I don't know what I would have done without this pillar of strength.
