abstract = {The growth of diamond thin films on a scratched silicon crystal surface$\backslash$nby a chemical-vapor deposition technique is reported. The substrate was$\backslash$nbombarded by sputtered carbon from a graphite target in a helium dc glow$\backslash$ndischarge, and subsequently exposed to atomic hydrogen generated by a$\backslash$nhot tungsten filament. The resulting diamond films were characterized by$\backslash$nRaman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Deposited film$\backslash$nquality and growth rate were studied as functions of carbon and atomic$\backslash$nhydrogen exposure. An increase in growth rate of diamond was observed$\backslash$nwith atomic hydrogen exposure. We also observe that only the first$\backslash$nmonolayer of carbon deposited with each exposure appears to be utilized.$\backslash$nThese observations suggest that the diamond growth is a surface$\backslash$nreaction. Further, calculations based upon the carbon utilization in$\backslash$ntraditional hot filament reactors indicate that a gas-phase reaction$\backslash$nprocess can account for neither the growth rate nor the saturation$\backslash$nbehavior observed. Based on this work it is proposed that the growth of$\backslash$ndiamond films is govemed by surface reactions, and that the necessity of$\backslash$ngas-phase precursors can be precluded.},

abstract = {Arrays of photon-counting Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (APDs) sensitive to 1.06 and 1.55 ?m wavelengths and as large as 256 x 64 elements on 50 ?m pitch have been fabricated for defense applications. As array size, and element density increase, optical crosstalk becomes an increasingly limiting source of spurious counts. We characterize the crosstalk by measurement of emitted light, and by extracting the spatial and temporal focal plane array (FPA) response to the light from FPA dark count statistics. We discuss the physical and geometrical causes of FPA crosstalk, suggest metrics useful to system designers, then present measured crosstalk metrics for large FPAs as a function of their operating parameters. We then present FPA designs that suppress crosstalk effects and show more than 40 times reduction in crosstalk.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a quantum nanophotonics platform based on germanium-vacancy (GeV) color centers in fiber-coupled diamond nanophotonic waveguides. We show that GeV optical transitions have a high quantum efficiency and are nearly lifetime-broadened in such nanophotonic structures. These properties yield an efficient interface between waveguide photons and a single GeV without the use of a cavity or slow-light waveguide. As a result, a single GeV center reduces waveguide transmission by {\$}18 \backslashpm 1\backslash{\%}{\$} on resonance in a single pass. We use a nanophotonic interferometer to perform homodyne detection of GeV resonance fluorescence. By probing the photon statistics of the output field, we demonstrate that the GeV-waveguide system is nonlinear at the single-photon level.},

In this work, we demonstrate that diamond films grown on a silicon substrate by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition can host bright, narrowband single photon emitters in the visible—near infra-red spectral range. The emitters possess fast lifetime (∼several ns), absolute photostability, and exhibit full polarization at excitation and emission. Pulsed and continuous laser excitations confirm their quantum behaviour at room temperature, while low temperature spectroscopy is performed to investigate inhomogeneous broadening. Our results advance the knowledge of solid state single photon sources and open pathways for their practical implementation in quantum communication and quantum information processing.},

Subsequently, diamond nucleation and growth was performed in a chemical vapor deposition setup. The epitaxial orientation relationship measured by x-ray diffraction is diamond(001)[110]∥Ir(001)[110]∥YSZ(001) [110]∥Si(001)[110]. The mosaicity of the diamondfilms is about an order of magnitude lower than for deposition directly on silicon without buffer layers and nearly reaches the values reported for single-crystaldiamond on Ir/SrTiO 3 .

abstract = {This work extensively investigates single silicon vacancy (SiV) color centers in diamond which are promising candidates for solid state single photon sources. The SiV centers are hosted by synthetic chemical vapor deposition diamonds in which they are created during the growth due to the incorporation of silicon impurities. The SiV centers display outstanding spectral properties including bright zero-phonon-lines (ZPLs, wavelengths mostly between 736 nm and 746 nm) with linewidths as narrow as 0.7 nm together with a distinct concentration of the fluorescence (approx. 70{\%}) in the ZPL. With single photon count rates up to 6.2 Mcps under continuous excitation, SiV centers are the brightest single color centers at present. Intensity auto-correlation measurements reveal three level population dynamics including a shelving state from which the SiV center can be reactivated by the excitation laser. Besides the ZPL, we identify previously unobserved electronic transitions in the spectral range between 820 nm and 840 nm. Using polarization spectroscopy, we investigate for the first time the transition dipole(s) for a single SiV center and find a single {\textless}110{\textgreater}-oriented dipole enabling fully linearly polarized single photon emission. Spectroscopy at cryogenic temperature for the first time reveals the ZPL fine structure of a single SiV center as well as mostly temperature independent population dynamics. In dieser Arbeit werden einzelne Silizium-Fehlstellen (SiV) Farbzentren in Diamant untersucht. Diese sind vielversprechende Kandidaten f{\"{u}}r festk{\"{o}}rperbasierte Einzelphotonenquellen. Die SiV Zentren entstehen w{\"{a}}hrend des Wachstums in synthetischen, durch Gasphasenabscheidung hergestellten Diamanten aus Silizium-Verunreinigungen.

abstract = {The optimization of diamond films as valuable engineering materials for a wide variety of applications has required the development of robust methods for their characterization. Of the many methods used, Raman microscopy is perhaps the most valuable because it provides readily distinguishable signatures of each of the different forms of carbon (e.g. diamond, graphite, buckyballs). In addition it is non-destructive, requires little or no specimen preparation, is performed in air and can produce spatially resolved maps of the different forms of carbon within a specimen. This article begins by reviewing the strengths (and some of the pitfalls) of the Raman technique for the analysis of diamond and diamond films and surveys some of the latest developments (for example, surface-enhanced Raman and ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy) which hold the promise of providing a more profound understanding of the outstanding properties of these materials. The remainder of the article is devoted to the uses of Raman spectroscopy in diamond science and technology. Topics covered include using Raman spectroscopy to assess stress, crystalline perfection, phase purity, crystallite size, point defects and doping in diamond and diamond films.},

The similar response of single centers and a SiV ensemble in a low strain reference sample proves our ability to fabricate almost perfect single SiVs, revealing the true nature of the defect's electronic properties. We model the electronic states using a group-theoretical approach yielding a good agreement with the experimental observations.

abstract = {This thesis demonstrates the deterministic coupling of single optically active nitrogen- vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers to monolithic photonic crystal cavities (PhC) realized in single crystal diamond. To this end, we develop a fabrication technique for 300 nm-thick free-standing diamond membranes and their subsequent pat- terning using focused ion beam milling. This allows us to observe PhC modes of high optical quality factors (Q = 1, 200) and small modal volumes (1($\lambda$/n)) in single crystal diamond for the first time. For controlled coupling of single color centers to PhC modes, we develop a method for frequency-tuning the monolithic cavities and for controlling the emitter-cavity positioning based on two approaches: The first approach involves targeted implantation of nitrogen ions at the center of PhCs fabricated in ultra-pure diamond. Using confocal spectroscopy, we confirm the successful creation of a few NV centers within the PhCs. The second approach is based on a tailored fabrication pro- cess of PhCs around pre-characterized single SiV centers. The controlled coupling to the nanocavity allows demonstrating resonant enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of a single SiV center by a factor of 2.7 coming along with a 19-fold increase in the intensity. The results of this work are promising for future applications in quantum information science such as the realization of efficient cavity-enhanced single photon sources or spin-photon interfaces for the use in quantum networks.},

One of the advantages of MUB-QT is that it requires projections from a minimal number of bases to be performed. In our scheme, the higher dimensional quantum systems are encoded using the propagation modes of single photons, and we take advantage of the capabilities of amplitude- and phase-modulation of programmable spatial light modulators to implement the MUB-QT.},

@article{Moehring2007,
abstract = {Quantum information science involves the storage, manipulation and communication of information encoded in quantum systems, where the phenomena of superposition and entanglement can provide enhancements over what is possible classically. Large-scale quantum information processors require stable and addressable quantum memories, usually in the form of fixed quantum bits (qubits), and a means of transferring and entangling the quantum information between memories that may be separated by macroscopic or even geographic distances. Atomic systems are excellent quantum memories, because appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store qubits over very long timescales. Photons, on the other hand, are the natural platform for the distribution of quantum information between remote qubits, given their ability to traverse large distances with little perturbation. Recently, there has been considerable progress in coupling small samples of atomic gases through photonic channels, including the entanglement between light and atoms and the observation of entanglement signatures between remotely located atomic ensembles. In contrast to atomic ensembles, single-atom quantum memories allow the implementation of conditional quantum gates through photonic channels, a key requirement for quantum computing. Along these lines, individual atoms have been coupled to photons in cavities, and trapped atoms have been linked to emitted photons in free space. Here we demonstrate the entanglement of two fixed single-atom quantum memories separated by one metre. Two remotely located trapped atomic ions each emit a single photon, and the interference and detection of these photons signals the entanglement of the atomic qubits. We characterize the entangled pair by directly measuring qubit correlations with near-perfect detection efficiency. Although this entanglement method is probabilistic, it is still in principle useful for subsequent quantum operations and scalable quantum information applications.},

We report on a simple and environmentally friendly route involving oxidation in air to selectively remove sp(2)-bonded carbon from ND. Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ Raman spectroscopy shows that sp(2) and sp(3) carbon species oxidize with different rates at 375-450 degrees C and reveals a narrow temperature range of 400-430 degrees C in which the oxidation of sp(2)-bonded carbon occurs with no or minimal loss of diamond. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy detects an increase of up to 2 orders of magnitude in the sp(3)/sp(2) ratio after oxidation. The content of up to 96{\%} of sp(3)-bonded carbon in the oxidized samples is comparable to that found in microcrystalline diamond and is unprecedented for ND powders. Transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies show high purity 5-nm ND particles covered by oxygen-containing surface functional groups. The surface functionalization can be controlled by subsequent treatments (e.g., hydrogenization). In contrast to current purification techniques, the air oxidation process does not require the use of toxic or aggressive chemicals, catalysts, or inhibitors and opens avenues for numerous new applications of nanodiamond.},

Although nitrogen-vacancy centres have been observed in aggregated detonation nanodiamonds and milled nanodiamonds, they have not been observed in very small isolated nanodiamonds. Here, we report the first direct observation of nitrogen-vacancy centres in discrete 5-nm nanodiamonds at room temperature, including evidence for intermittency in the luminescence (blinking) from the nanodiamonds. We also show that it is possible to control this blinking by modifying the surface of the nanodiamonds.},

The compounds show a high concentration of paramagnetic centers (up to 1020 spin/g), which are due to structural defects (dangling C–C bonds) on the diamond cluster surface. The anomalous reduction in the spin–lattice relaxation time of 13C (from several hours in natural diamond to ∼150ms in UDD clusters) is attributed to the interaction between the unpaired electrons of the paramagnetic centers and nuclear spins. 13C NMR line-width reflects the fact that the structure of the UDD surface is distorted in comparison to the ‘bulk' diamond structure.},

Strong relatively sharp peaks are observed in the Raman spectra at 500, 1140, 1132 and 1630cm−1. By comparing the Raman spectra of the nanodiamond clusters with that of amorphized diamond and with calculations of the vibrational density of states we are able to suggest the origin of features in the vibrational spectrum from nanocrystalline diamond.},

It is used in conjunction with the SPD, ECAL and HCAL to search for clusters of 2 × 2 cells and to identify e, $\gamma$ , $\pi$°, hadron of highest E T . This contribution discusses the requirements for the synchronisation and calibration of the PS detector, as well as the methods that were used to determine the first settings before the LHC start-up.

abstract = {The controlled production of single photons is of fundamental and practical interest; they represent the lowest excited quantum states of the radiation field, and have applications in quantum cryptography and quantum information processing. Common approaches use the fluorescence of single ions, single molecules, colour centres and semiconductor quantum dots. However, the lack of control over such irreversible emission processes precludes the use of these sources in applications (such as quantum networks) that require coherent exchange of quantum states between atoms and photons. The necessary control may be achieved in principle in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although this approach has been used for the production of single photons from atoms, such experiments are compromised by limited trapping times, fluctuating atom-field coupling and multi-atom effects. Here we demonstrate a single-photon source based on a strongly localized single ion in an optical cavity. The ion is optimally coupled to a well-defined field mode, resulting in the generation of single-photon pulses with precisely defined shape and timing. We have confirmed the suppression of two-photon events up to the limit imposed by fluctuations in the rate of detector dark counts. The stream of emitted photons is uninterrupted over the storage time of the ion, as demonstrated by a measurement of photon correlations over 90 min.},

Recent progress has brought spin photonics research in these materials into the quantum realm, allowing the demonstration of spin-photon entanglement, which in turn has enabled distant spin entanglement as well as quantum teleportation.

abstract = {Quantum communication requires the transfer of quantum states, or quantum bits of information (qubits), from one place to another. From a fundamental perspective, this allows the distribution of entanglement and the demonstration of quantum non-locality over significant distances. Within the context of applications, quantum cryptography offers a provably secure way to establish a confidential key between distant partners. Photons represent the natural flying qubit carriers for quantum communication, and the presence of telecommunications optical fibres makes the wavelengths of 1,310 nm and 1,550 nm particularly suitable for distribution over long distances. However, qubits encoded into alkaline atoms that absorb and emit at wavelengths around 800 nm have been considered for the storage and processing of quantum information. Hence, future quantum information networks made of telecommunications channels and alkaline memories will require interfaces that enable qubit transfers between these useful wavelengths, while preserving quantum coherence and entanglement. Here we report a demonstration of qubit transfer between photons of wavelength 1,310 nm and 710 nm. The mechanism is a nonlinear up-conversion process, with a success probability of greater than 5 per cent. In the event of a successful qubit transfer, we observe strong two-photon interference between the 710 nm photon and a third photon at 1,550 nm, initially entangled with the 1,310 nm photon, although they never directly interacted. The corresponding fidelity is higher than 98 per cent.},

abstract = {Raman spectra of diamond powders with size less than 2 $\mu$m have been measured as a function of the particle size. The Raman line was found to become more asymmetric with some tailing towards lower Raman shifts, broader, and weaker with decreasing particle size. The observed result can be explained by a phonon confinement effect rather than by a strain effect. This work predicts that it is very difficult to detect Raman spectra of diamond particles with size less than ∼50 {\AA}. A broad Raman band, whose intensity becomes stronger with decreasing particle size, was observed around 600 cm-1 in the spectra of diamond powders with particle size less than 2 $\mu$m. We hypothesize that the broad band arises from transverse acoustic phonons near the Brillouin zone boundary because of the relaxation in the wave vector selection rule.},

abstract = {Raman microscopy has been employed to investigate the nature of damage created when natural type-IIa diamond is irradiated with MeV alpha particles. Three features appear in the Raman spectrum due to damage, viz., i the first-order diamond Raman line is broadened and downshifted, ii broad features appear which are a measure of the vibrational density of states of ion-beam-amorphized diamond, and iii the damage causes the appearance of sharp defect-induced Raman peaks at 1490 and 1630 cm1. For damage below an amorphization threshold, a linear relationship exists between the full width at half maximum and frequency shift, which shows that these are Kramers-Kronig related. The annealing behavior of the sharp Raman feature at 1490 cm1 suggests that this peak is associated with vacancies with an activation energy for annealing of 4.06 eV, while the 1630-cm1 peak is due to an interstitial related defect with an activation energy of 1.2 eV. For sub-MeV ion irradiation, damage beyond the critical amorphization level usually leads to relaxation of the diamond structure to graphite upon thermal annealing. However, for MeV ion irradiation, it was found that annealing, even when the ion induced damage level is well above the amorphization threshold, could restore the original diamond structure. We attribute this result to the high internal pressure the damaged layer is subjected to which does not allow relaxation to graphitically bonded structures.},

This behavior is highly sensitive to strain, which modifies the excited states, and was unexpected following recent experiments demonstrating optical readout of single nitrogen-vacancy electron spins based on cycling transitions.

abstract = {The optical transmission spectra of several diamonds have been studied over the range 5{\textperiodcentered}0 to 6{\textperiodcentered}0 eV (2450 to 2000 {\AA}) and at many temperatures between 90 and 600 °K. The reflexion spectrum was also recorded between 5 and 14 eV (2450 to 900 {\AA}) at 295 °K and between 5 and 8 eV (2450 to 1550 {\AA}) at 133 °K. The intrinsic features of the absorption edge spectrum are discussed in terms of allowed indirect electronic transitions into exciton and free carrier states of the crystal. A weak absorption component, exhibited only by a p -type semiconducting specimen (type II b ), is tentatively identified with an exciton state bound to the acceptor centre. Analysis of the absorption data yields six phonon energies. Three of these are greater than the Raman energy ( h$\omega$ )R and appear to represent combinations of two or more phonons having the following energies: (1) ( k$\omega$ ) Raman = 0{\textperiodcentered}167 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}010 eV, (2) ( k$\omega$ ) transverse optical = 0{\textperiodcentered}143 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}002 eV, (3) ( k$\omega$ ) longitudinal optical, acoustical =0{\textperiodcentered}132 + 0{\textperiodcentered}002 eV, (4) ( k$\omega$ ) transverse acoustical = 0{\textperiodcentered}083 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}003 eV. The classification of the phonons (2) to (4) given above is discussed in the light of the current knowledge of the lattice vibrational spectrum of diamond. The present results suggest that the lowest minima of the conduction band are near to the boundaries of the reduced zone in the {\textless};100{\textgreater} direction (symmetry point X 1), if the maximum of the valence bands lies at the zone centre. The binding energy of the indirect exciton, measured from the absorption spectra, is 0{\textperiodcentered}070 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}004 eV. The density of states effective mass of electrons at the lowest conduction-band minima, estimated from this result, is ca. 0{\textperiodcentered}2 m , where m is the mass of a free electron. The indirect energy gap at 295 °K and its rate of change of temperature between 135 and 295 °K, obtained from the absorption data, are Eg = 5{\textperiodcentered}470 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}005 eV ; d Eg /d T = -5{\textperiodcentered}4 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}5 x 10-5 eV /degK The corresponding values for th e direct energy gap, obtained from th e reflexion d ata, are Eg = 7{\textperiodcentered}02 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}02 eV ; d Eg /d T = -6{\textperiodcentered}3 ± 1{\textperiodcentered}8 x 10-4 eV /degK Finally, a broad peak has been observed in the reflexion spectrum at the energy predicted for the direct transition at {\textless}111{\textgreater} zone boundaries in diamond (9{\textperiodcentered}2 ±0{\textperiodcentered}1 eV).},

@article{Handsteiner,
abstract = {Bell's theorem states that some predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced by a local-realist theory. That conflict is expressed by Bell's inequality, which is usually derived under the assumption that there are no statistical correlations between the choices of measurement settings and anything else that can causally affect the measurement outcomes. In previous experiments, this " freedom of choice " was addressed by ensuring that selection of measurement settings via conventional " quantum random number generators " was spacelike separated from the entangled particle creation. This, however, left open the possibility that an unknown cause affected both the setting choices and measurement outcomes as recently as mere microseconds before each experimental trial. Here we report on a new experimental test of Bell's inequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources as " cosmic setting generators. " In our tests with polarization-entangled photons, measurement settings were chosen using real-time observations of Milky Way stars while simultaneously ensuring locality. Assuming fair sampling for all detected photons, and that each stellar photon's color was set at emission, we observe statistically significant ≳7.31$\sigma$ and ≳11.93$\sigma$ violations of Bell's inequality with estimated p values of ≲1.8 × 10 −13 and ≲4.0 × 10 −33 , respectively, thereby pushing back by ∼600 years the most recent time by which any local-realist influences could have engineered the observed Bell violation. In this Letter, we report on a new experimental test of Bell's inequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources to choose measurement settings. This is the first in a series of " cosmic Bell tests " that will use progressively more distant sources, ultimately pushing the measurement settings' origin to greater and greater cosmological distances [1]. Background.—Scientists have struggled with the alleged incompatibility of quantum entanglement and our everyday intuitions about the physical world since the seminal paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 [2]. EPR concluded that the description of reality given by the quantum-mechanical wave function is incomplete because it is incompatible with the concepts of locality (no physical influences can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum) and realism (objects possess complete sets of properties on their own, prior to measurement). A well-known " tool " to experimentally distinguish between the quantum predictions and local-realist alternatives of the sort envisaged by EPR is provided by the famous inequality derived by John Bell in 1964 [3]. Assuming locality and realism, Bell's inequality limits the degree to which measurement outcomes on pairs of distant systems may be correlated, if the measurements of one system are carried out with only limited information about the other. By contrast, measurements on entangled particle pairs in the quantum singlet state, for example, are predicted to violate Bell's inequality. Beginning with Ref. [4], essentially all significant experimental Bell tests to date have supported the quantum-mechanical predictions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Metallic nanoparticles and nanoantennas have been extensively studied due to their capability to increase electromagnetic field confinement which is essential in numerous applications ranging from optoelectronics to telecommunication and sensing devices. We show that a double bowtie nanoantenna has a higher electric field confinement in its gap compared to a single bowtie nanoantenna, which is expected to give better fluorescence enhancement of a single emitter placed in the gap. We show that the electric field intensity can be further increased by placing the double bowtie inside a ring grating structure where the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) is achieved. We perform FDTD simulations to characterise the double bowtie nanoantenna and study the effect of its dimensions on the electric field enhancement in the gap. Our proposed integrated structure with gratings is shown to increase the electric field by a factor of 77 due to a double cavity effect. Next steps would be to study the fluorescence enhancement of emitters placed inside our double bowtie / ring grating nanocavity to see if the strong coupling regime can be attained.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For many years, studying nanophotonic phenomena was limited to traditional semiconductors (including silicon and GaAs) and experiments were carried out predominantly at cryogenic temperatures. In the last decade, however, diamond has emerged as a new contender to study photonic phenomena at the nanoscale. Offering a plethora of quantum emitters that are optically active at room temperature and ambient conditions, diamond has been exploited to demonstrate super-resolution microscopy and realize entanglement, Purcell enhancement, and other quantum and classical nanophotonic effects. Elucidating the importance of diamond as a material, this progress report highlights the recent achievements in the fi eld of diamond nanophotonics, and conveys a roadmap for future experiments and technological advancements.},

abstract = {Results of an extensive study of defect centers in chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond by optical transmittance, photoconductivity, photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation (PLE) techniques are reported. Oscillatory behavior in PLE spectra for the silicon-vacancy center is observed and utilized to deduce EC−2.05 eV as the optical ionization threshold for this center. A threshold at this energy is also seen in optical absorption spectra. It is shown that the IR absorption band at 800 cm−1 due to Si–C vibrations can originate from Si–C bonds inside a diamond film, but not at the film–substrate interface. It is suggested that the increase in amorphous carbon (a-C) related defects tends to pin the surface Fermi level position around EV+1 eV level, creating potential barriers across a polycrystalline diamond film, while nitrogen doping raises the bulk Fermi level position towards the conduction band. Therefore, variations in a-C and nitrogen contents can affect the population of defect levels in CVD diamond, which may lead to erroneous conclusions about the changes in the concentration of those centers on the basis of absorption or luminescence results.},

abstract = {The split silicon-vacancy defect (SiV) in diamond is an electrically and optically active color center. Recently, it has been shown that this color center is bright and can be detected at the single defect level. In addition, the SiV defect shows a non-zero electronic spin ground state that potentially makes this defect an alternative candidate for quantum optics and metrology applications beside the well-known nitrogen-vacancy color center in diamond. However, the electronic structure of the defect, the nature of optical excitations and other related properties are not well-understood. Here we present advanced ab initio study on SiV defect in diamond. We determine the formation energies, charge transition levels and the nature of excitations of the defect. Our study unravel the origin of the dark or shelving state for the negatively charged SiV defect associated with the 1.68-eV photoluminescence center.

abstract = {Photonic nanostructures provide a way of tailoring the interaction between light and matter and the past decade has witnessed a tremendous experimental and theoretical progress on this subject. In particular, the combination with semiconductor quantum dots has proven very successful. This manuscript reviews quantum optics with excitons in single quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures. The ability to engineer the interaction strength in integrated photonic nanostructures enables a range of fundamental quantum-electrodynamics experiments on, e.g., spontaneous-emission control, modified Lamb shifts, and enhanced dipole-dipole interaction. Furthermore, highly efficient single-photon sources and giant photon nonlinearities may be constructed with immediate applications for photonic quantum-information processing. The review summarizes the general theoretical framework of photon emission including the role of dephasing processes, and applies it to photonic nanostructures of current interest, such as photonic-crystal cavities and waveguides, dielectric nanowires, and plasmonic waveguides. Finally, the progress and future prospects of applications in quantum-information processing are considered.},

abstract = {We describe a new simple and easy technique called the "Hook and roll technique" (HRT) that uses an articulating hook cautery to provide a critical view during single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). A 2-cm incision is made at the umbilicus to insert three 5-mm trocars or a multichannel port. After dissection of the serosa of the dorsal and ventral sides of the gall bladder, including Calot's triangle, the angled tip of the hook cautery is inserted between the cystic artery and duct with its tip placed dorsally. The tip is then rotated in a clockwise manner to avoid bile duct injury, allowing the connective tissue between them to be hooked, coagulated and cut. This procedure is repeated several times, followed by dissection between the cystic artery and the liver bed to achieve a critical view. From December 2008 to May 2011, 121 patients underwent SILC using HRT in our hospital without any serious complications. This technique is suitable for SILC, as it is consists of simple procedures that can be performed safely and easily, even by left hand in a cross-over approach, and it allows complete dissection of Calot's triangle to achieve a critical view without using any dissector under dangerous in-line viewing.},

Diamonds were deposited on molybdenum and tantalum by hot filament and microwave CVD methods at growth rates between 10 and 30 $\mu$m{\textperiodcentered}h-1. Crystals from 10 to 40 $\mu$m size were examined. Local stress was evaluated by analyzing the position, broadening and splitting of the 1332 cm-1 Raman peak in a 3D mapping. For the (001) orientation, the most stressed zone was found at the center of the crystal base, close to the interface with the substrate: a Raman peak around 1340 cm-1 was measured, corresponding to a pressure c.a. 3 GPa, according to our dynamical calculations. This peak disappears few microns out of the center, suggesting that this highly concentrated stress sector was the nucleation zone of the crystal. A shifting and slight broadening of the 1332 cm-1 band was observed in the rest of the crystal. The causes of these effects are discussed: they proved not to be due to anisotropic stress but to refractive effects. Same results were found for different crystal sizes and growth rates.},

abstract = {This work describes the coupling of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond to a fiber-based Fabry-Perot cavity. To realize the cavities, concave imprints on fiber facets are produced by laser machining or focused ion beam milling and subsequently coated with a highly reflective mirror-stack. Nanodiamonds containing single NV cen- ters are incorporated into cavities, that consist either of one plane mirror and one fiber mirror or of two fiber mirrors. Characterizing both the emission into free-space and the cavity-coupled emission of the very same NV center allows to demonstrate a cavity- enhanced emission: 2-4{\%} of the total emission of the NV center is directed into the cavity mode with a linewidth of approximately 10GHz. We thereby have realized a tunable narrow-band single photon source. Starting from a master equation approach a rate equation model is deduced that provides insights into the underlying physical processes: the emitter-cavity coupling leads to phonon induced off-resonant channeling of the emission into the narrow cavity mode. The measurements of the cavity emission rate at different wavelengths are well reproduced by this model. The results of this work are promising for future applications in quantum information science such as re- alization of a source of indistinguishable photons, cavity enhanced spin read-out of the NV center and realization of a spin-photon interface for use in quantum networks.},

Brief gemo-logical discussions of diamond types appeared in Shigley et al. (1986), Fritsch and Scarratt (1992), and Smith et al.

abstract = {Quantum entanglement is among the most fascinating aspects of quantum theory. Entangled optical photons are now widely used for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and applications such as quantum cryptography. Several recent experiments demonstrated entanglement of optical photons with trapped ions, atoms and atomic ensembles, which are then used to connect remote long-term memory nodes in distributed quantum networks. Here we realize quantum entanglement between the polarization of a single optical photon and a solid-state qubit associated with the single electronic spin of a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond. Our experimental entanglement verification uses the quantum eraser technique, and demonstrates that a high degree of control over interactions between a solid-state qubit and the quantum light field can be achieved. The reported entanglement source can be used in studies of fundamental quantum phenomena and provides a key building block for the solid-state realization of quantum optical networks.},

abstract = {Doping of carbon nanoparticles with impurity atoms is central to their application. However, doping has proven elusive for very small carbon nanoparticles because of their limited availability and a lack of fundamental understanding of impurity stability in such nanostructures. Here, we show that isolated diamond nanoparticles as small as 1.6 nm, comprising only ∼400 carbon atoms, are capable of housing stable photoluminescent colour centres, namely the silicon vacancy (SiV). Surprisingly, fluorescence from SiVs is stable over time, and few or only single colour centres are found per nanocrystal. We also observe size-dependent SiV emission supported by quantum-chemical simulation of SiV energy levels in small nanodiamonds. Our work opens the way to investigating the physics and chemistry of molecular-sized cubic carbon clusters and promises the application of ultrasmall non-perturbative fluorescent nanoparticles as markers in microscopy and sensing.},

abstract = {The candela, the SI (syst{\`{e}}me internationale) unit for optical radiation, has been one of the base units since the inception of the system. The latest definition was in 1979, when it was linked to the derived unit, the watt. Advances in optical technology and the needs of the communication sector suggest that it is timely that consideration be given to redefining the candela in terms of fundamental quantum optical entities, i.e. photons. Validation of this approach will require comparison against the most accurate conventional technique, cryogenic radiometry. A definition in terms of photon number and the requirements for demonstrating equivalence with existing techniques is discussed, together with new possibilities which would result from further improvements in accuracy. Work being carried out at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) towards these goals is described, drawing on developments of photon-counting calibration techniques and low temperature measurements, and research into single photon sources and detectors.},

abstract = {Teleportation of a quantum state encompasses the complete transfer of information from one particle to another. The complete specification of the quantum state of a system generally requires an infinite amount of information, even for simple two-level systems (qubits). Moreover, the principles of quantum mechanics dictate that any measurement on a system immediately alters its state, while yielding at most one bit of information. The transfer of a state from one system to another (by performing measurements on the first and operations on the second) might therefore appear impossible. However, it has been shown that the entangling properties of quantum mechanics, in combination with classical communication, allow quantum-state teleportation to be performed. Teleportation using pairs of entangled photons has been demonstrated, but such techniques are probabilistic, requiring post-selection of measured photons. Here, we report deterministic quantum-state teleportation between a pair of trapped calcium ions. Following closely the original proposal, we create a highly entangled pair of ions and perform a complete Bell-state measurement involving one ion from this pair and a third source ion. State reconstruction conditioned on this measurement is then performed on the other half of the entangled pair. The measured fidelity is 75{\%}, demonstrating unequivocally the quantum nature of the process.},

The 420 and 540 nm lines are created with the irradiation of the beam, and grow followed by fading. A 410 nm broad band is found to grow with the irradiation. On the other hand, a 485 nm line goes down, while the free exciton line does not change in its intensity. Intensities of the bands depend on growth sector of the diamond, and remain after stopping the irradiation. The behavior of the luminescence bands suggests that as-grown diamond contains several defects changeable with electron beam with subthreshold energy.},

For the sake of integration and to provide an electron photon interface, it is of great interest to stimulate single-photon emission by electrical excitation as demonstrated for quantum dots. Because of low exciton binding energies, it has so far not been possible to detect sub-Poissonian photon statistics of electrically driven quantum dots at room temperature. However, organic molecules possess exciton binding energies on the order of 1eV, thereby facilitating the development of an electrically driven single-photon source at room temperature in a solid-state matrix. Here we demonstrate electroluminescence of single, electrically driven molecules at room temperature. By careful choice of the molecular emitter, as well as fabrication of a specially designed organic light-emitting diode structure, we were able to achieve stable single-molecule emission and detect sub-Poissonian photon statistics.},

We show that single defects exhibit several striking features at cryogenic temperature: the photoluminescence is strongly concentrated into a sharp zero-phonon line (ZPL) in the NIR, the radiative lifetime is in the nanosecond range and the emission is linearly polarized. The spectral stability of the defects is then investigated. An optical resonance linewidth of 4 GHz is measured using resonant excitation on the ZPL.

A corresponding increase in lattice constant is found to be as high as 0.01{\%} for a nitrogen content of 0.2{\%}. Concentration, X-ray, and density data suggest that nitrogen occupies a substitutional position in the diamond lattice. The infrared absorption bands at 7.8, 8.3, 9.1, and 20.8 $\mu$ are considered to be C-N molecular vibrations. Several optical, electrical, and thermal properties of diamond are discussed in view of our findings.},

abstract = {Synthetic diamond production is key to the development of quantum metrology and quantum information applications of diamond. The major quantum sensor and qubit candidate in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center. This lattice defect comes in four different crystallographic orientations leading to an intrinsic inhomogeneity among NV centers that is undesirable in some applications. Here, we report a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor decomposition (MPCVD) diamond growth technique on (111)-oriented substrates that yields perfect alignment ({\$}94\backslashpm2{\%}{\$}) of as-grown NV centers along a single crystallographic direction. In addition, clear evidence is found that the majority ({\$}74\backslashpm4{\%}{\$}) of the aligned NV centers were formed by the nitrogen being first included in the (111) growth surface and then followed by the formation of a neighboring vacancy on top. The achieved homogeneity of the grown NV centers will tremendously benefit quantum information and metrology applications.},

This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre.

abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential to perform certain computational tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts. The Cirac-Zoller proposal for a scalable quantum computer is based on a string of trapped ions whose electronic states represent the quantum bits of information (or qubits). In this scheme, quantum logical gates involving any subset of ions are realized by coupling the ions through their collective quantized motion. The main experimental step towards realizing the scheme is to implement the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation between two individual ions. The CNOT quantum logical gate corresponds to the XOR gate operation of classical logic that flips the state of a target bit conditioned on the state of a control bit. Here we implement a CNOT quantum gate according to the Cirac-Zoller proposal. In our experiment, two 40Ca+ ions are held in a linear Paul trap and are individually addressed using focused laser beams; the qubits are represented by superpositions of two long-lived electronic states. Our work relies on recently developed precise control of atomic phases and the application of composite pulse sequences adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.},

One of the central challenges in the realization of such a deterministic device based on a single quantum emitter concerns the collection of the photons, which are radiated into a 4$\pi$ solid angle. Here, we present the fabrication and characterization of an optical antenna designed to convert the dipolar radiation of an arbitrarily oriented quantum emitter to a directional beam with more than 99{\%} efficiency. Our approach is extremely versatile and can be used for more efficient detection of nanoscopic emitters ranging from semiconductor quantum dots to dye molecules, color centers, or rare-earth ions in various environments. Having addressed the issue of collection efficiency, we also discuss the photophysical limitations of the existing quantum emitters for the realization of a deterministic single-photon source.},

It was found from the annealed sample that the CL spectra which changed with the irradiation are partially recovered, namely, the lines at 420 nm and 540 nm formed with the irradiation are annealed out, and the lines at 485 nm, 535 nm and 545 nm which disappeared with the irradiation are recovered. However the 420 nm broad band that appeared with the irradiation does not change with the heat treatment. The effect of the heat treatment suggests that the CL peaks which changed with the irradiation are related to ionization of defects.},

abstract = {Results on stress analysis for single-crystal diamonds are presented. Isolated crystals were studied by Raman mapping and depth profiling techniques, using confocal microscopy. Diamonds were deposited on molybdenum and tantalum by hot filament and microwave CVD methods at growth rates between 10 and 30 $\mu$m{\textperiodcentered}h-1. Crystals from 10 to 40 $\mu$m size were examined. Local stress was evaluated by analyzing the position, broadening and splitting of the 1332 cm-1 Raman peak in a 3D mapping. For the (001) orientation, the most stressed zone was found at the center of the crystal base, close to the interface with the substrate: a Raman peak around 1340 cm-1 was measured, corresponding to a pressure c.a. 3 GPa, according to our dynamical calculations. This peak disappears few microns out of the center, suggesting that this highly concentrated stress sector was the nucleation zone of the crystal. A shifting and slight broadening of the 1332 cm-1 band was observed in the rest of the crystal. The causes of these effects are discussed: they proved not to be due to anisotropic stress but to refractive effects. Same results were found for different crystal sizes and growth rates.},

abstract = {The Si-V defect center in diamond (737??nm; 1.682??eV) was long thought to occur only in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown or Si-doped HPHT-grown synthetic diamonds. We report, for the first time, the occurrence of the Si-V defect in ten gem-quality colorless natural diamonds. Many of these samples, including type IIa and Ia diamonds, contained included crystals of olivine (Fo93-95) and garnet (Ca-Mg-rich), proving their natural origin. The 737??nm photoluminescence feature (actually a doublet at 736.5 and 736.9??nm at 77??K) occurred in association with several additional and previously unreported peaks at 524.4, 550.4, 554.3, 557.9, 558.2, 573.5, 593.3, 594.8, and 714.7??nm, as well as two series of peaks in the ranges 535-539 and 644-652??nm. The intensities of the associated peaks were proportional to the 737 features, suggesting their association with Si as well. Based on olivine (Fo0.93-0.95) and garnet inclusion (Ca, Mg-rich) chemistry, these diamonds are peridotitic in nature, likely having formed in the upper mantle. The source of the Si remains unclear. Care must be taken to avoid confusion between these natural Si-V diamonds and CVD synthetic diamonds with Si-V features. Fortunately, many of the commonly reported CVD identification features are absent from natural Si-V diamonds, facilitating the separation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Semiconductor nanocrystals offer an enormous diversity of potential device applications, based on their size-tunable photoluminescence, high optical stability and ‘bottom-up' chemical approaches to self-assembly. However, the promise of such applications can be seriously limited by photoluminescence intermittency in nanocrystal emission, that is, ‘blinking', arising from the escape of either one or both of the photoexcited carriers to the nanocrystal surface. In the first scenario, the remaining nanocrystal charge quenches photoluminescence via non-radiative Auger recombination, whereas for the other, the exciton is thought to be intercepted before thermalization and does not contribute to the photoluminescence. This Review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for nanocrystal blinking kinetics as well as core–shell engineering efforts to control such phenomena. In particular, ‘softening' of the core–shell confinement potential strongly suppresses non- radiative Auger processes in charged nanocrystals, with successful non-blinking implementations demonstrated in CdSe–CdS core–thick-shell nanocrystals and their modification.},

Sources of single photons are extremely important across many applications as they can serve as vectors for quantum information—thereby allowing long-range (perhaps even global-scale) quantum states to be made and manipulated for tasks such as quantum communication or distributed quantum computation. At the single-emitter level, quantum sources also afford new possibilities in terms of nanoscopy and bio-marking. Color centers in diamond are prominent candidates to generate and manipulate quantum states of light, as they are a photostable solid-state source of single photons at room temperature. In this review, we discuss the state of the art of diamond-based single-photon emitters and highlight their fabrication methodologies. We present the experimental techniques used to characterize the quantum emitters and discuss their photophysical properties. We outline a number of applications including quantum key distribution, bio-marking and sub-diffraction imaging, where diamond-based single emitters are playing a crucial role. We conclude with a discussion of the main challenges and perspectives for employing diamond emitters in quantum information processing.},

Both, cavity in- and output are directly fiber-coupled and the emission wavelength is easily tunable by variation of the separation of the two mirrors with a piezo-electric crystal.

This analysis shows that an optimized metal-dielectric hybrid structure can increase the collected photon rate from a nitrogen vacancy center by over two orders of magnitude compared to a bare emitter.

Here we demonstrate bright silicon vacancy (SiV(-)) centres in low-strain bulk diamond, which show spectral overlap of up to 91{\%} and nearly transform-limited excitation linewidths. This is the first time that distinct single-photon emitters in the solid state have shown intrinsically identical spectral properties. Our results have impact on the application of single-photon sources for quantum optics and cryptography.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement between spatially separated objects is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics. The outcomes of independent measurements on entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. As well as being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled quantum bits (qubits) can be used to share private information or implement quantum logical gates. Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled qubits are spatially separated, providing the opportunity to create highly connected quantum networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here we report entanglement of two electron spin qubits in diamond with a spatial separation of three metres. We establish this entanglement using a robust protocol based on creation of spin-photon entanglement at each location and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations on local long-lived nuclear spin registers, paving the way for deterministic long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks.},

@article{Balasubramanian2008,
abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

abstract = {Fluorescent diamond nanocrystals are attracting increasing interest for a broad range of applications, from biolabeling and single particle tracking to nanoscale magnetic field sensing. Their fluorescence stems from nitrogen-vacancy color centers created within synthetic diamond nanoparticles by high-temperature annealing, which results in the association of pre-existing nitrogen impurities and vacancies generated by high-energy particle (electron, proton, or helium ion) beam irradiation. Up to now, diamond nanocrystals have been irradiated as dry powder in a container or deposited as a thin layer on a flat substrate, depending on the type and energy of the irradiating particles. However, these techniques suffer from intrinsic inhomogeneities: the fluence of particles may vary over the whole sample area, as well as the thickness and density of the nanodiamond layer. Here, we present an approach based on direct large-scale irradiation of nanodiamonds in aqueous colloidal solution by high-energy protons. This approach results in a larger fraction of fluorescent particles, with a more homogenous distribution of nitrogen-vacancy centers per particle and less severe lattice damages compared to dry powder irradiation.},

abstract = {In the current work, we show a detailed analysis of the transverse beam profile and polarization characteristics of devices with one and three oxide apertures. A Gaussian transverse beam profile is achieved with an oxide aperture diameter of less than 6 $\mu$m. The laser light is linearly polarized with a high degree of polarization ({\textgreater} 97 {\%}) in the complete current range. The stable polarization direction can be attributed to ordering effects ocurring during epitaxial growth of the GaInP material system and a reduction in crystal symmetry. Different oxide aperture diameters can be implemented in one device due to high oxidation selectivity of the AlxGa1-xAs layer depending on aluminum content. These deep oxidation layers lead to a reduction of the parasitic capacitance, while beam profile and polarization characteristics are not affected.},

The iridium layers had in-plane (twist) and out-of-plane (tilt) full widths at half maximum as narrow as 0.08° and 0.15°, respectively, up to an order of magnitude narrower than the underlying Sr Ti O 3 and YSZ layers.

abstract = {The ability to minimise, control and manipulate defects in CVD diamond has grown rapidly over the last ten years. The application which best illustrates this is probably that of quantum information processing (QIP) or 'diamond spintronics'. QIP is a rapidly growing area of research, covering diverse activities from computing and code breaking to encrypted communication. All these applications need 'quantum bits' or qubits where the quantum information can be maintained and controlled. Controlled defects in an otherwise high perfection diamond lattice are rapidly becoming a leading contender for qubits, and offer many advantages over alternative solutions. The most promising defect is the NV-defect whose unique properties allow the state of its electron spin to be optically written to and read from. Substantial developments in the synthesis of CVD diamond have produced diamond lattices with a high degree of perfection, such that the electron spin of this centre exhibits very long room temperature decoherence times (T2) in excess of 1 ms. This paper gives a brief review of the advantages and challenges of using CVD diamond as a qubit host. Lastly the various qubit applications being considered for diamond are discussed, highlighting the current state of development including the recent development of high sensitivity magnetometers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Thin metal films have recently attracted large interest due to their practical application in photo-detectors, solar cells and quantum electronics. It is known that thin films of noble metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu have a maximum optical transmittance in the shorter part of spectrum. In our work, optical properties of thin metals films deposited by thermal evaporation and low pressure (1.33{\textperiodcentered}10-5- 1.33{\textperiodcentered}10-4 Pa) DC plasma sputtering were investigated. Such low pressure is provided by triode sputtering method which supports a ballistic type of mass transfer between the sputtering target and the substrate. This method enables fine control of the film thickness and its density. Comparison of the films deposited by mentioned above two methods on glass substrates shows significant differences in their optical and electrical properties. Thin films of following metals: Sn, Al, V, Ti, Ni, Mo, Ta, W, Au, Ag, and Cu were deposited on glass and their optical and electrical properties were studied. The transmission spectra of thin films of various metals have significant differences. In our paper we discuss the causes of these differences.},

abstract = {Diamond nanocrystals that host room temperature narrowband single photon emitters are highly sought after for applications in nanophotonics and bioimaging. However, current understanding of the origin of these emitters is extremely limited. In this work, we demonstrate that the narrowband emitters are point defects localized at extended morphological defects in individual nanodiamonds. In particular, we show that nanocrystals with defects such as twin boundaries and secondary nucleation sites exhibit narrowband emission that is absent from pristine individual nanocrystals grown under the same conditions. Critically, we prove that the narrowband emission lines vanish when extended defects are removed deterministically using highly localized electron beam induced etching. Our results enhance the current understanding of single photon emitters in diamond and are directly relevant to fabrication of novel quantum optics devices and sensors.},

By restricting the observed volume, the technique keeps overlying or nearby scatterers from contributing to the detected signal.

@article{Alice2008,
abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m 3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

With no external field, the center exhibits a characteristic fourfold no-phonon PL fine structure plus weak additional components. The four main components are further split apart by uniaxial stress p?????? 100??? at linear rates. The energy level scheme deduced from these data and from thermalization measurements indicate that the center is under internal uniaxial overpressure at zero external stress. This is ascribed to its large size in the narrow diamond lattice. Complex splitting patterns are observed for applied magnetic fields which cannot fully be analyzed at present. The observed anisotropies indicate a non-cubic symmetry of the defect close to tetragonal, possibly slightly distorted towards lower symmetry. This is consistent with simple models of the defect involving silicon, nitrogen and a vacancy which are the established defect constituents. ?? 1995.},

A linear correlation was observed between the intensity of the 3107 cm-1 hydrogen-related peak and the concentration of IR-active nitrogen. It may be accounted for by the presence of NH3, NH4 and N2 gases as sources of nitrogen during diamond growth. It is shown that the unique blue-gray color of some Argyle diamonds is determined not only by the high hydrogen content, but also a small concentration of tri-nitrogen complexes in combination with a large concentration of two- and four-nitrogen defects. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, only doping of the samples during growth is available up to now, which yields a quite homogeneous doping density. In the present work, we deposit Er3+-ions by the focused ion beam technique at yttrium sites with several fluences in one sample. With a photoluminescence study of these locally doped Er3+:Y2SiO5 crystals, we are able to evaluate the efficiency of the implantation process and develop it for the highest efficiency possible. We observe the dependence of ion activation after the post-implantation annealing on the fluence value.},

We couple the fluorescence of individual silicon vacancy centers in nanodiamonds to a tunable optical microcavity to demonstrate a single photon source with high efficiency, increased emission rate, and improved spectral purity compared to the intrinsic emitter properties. We use a fiber-based microcavity with a mode volume as small as {\$}3.4{\~{}}\backslashlambda{\^{}}3{\$} and a quality factor of {\$}1.9\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}4{\$} and observe an effective Purcell factor of up to 9.2. We furthermore study modifications of the internal rate dynamics and propose a rate model that closely agrees with the measurements. We observe lifetime changes of up to 31{\%}, limited by the finite quantum efficiency of the emitters studied here. With improved materials, our achieved parameters predict single photon rates beyond 1 GHz.},

@article{Iii1991,
abstract = {The frequency and line shape of the diamond Raman line are examined in detail for a series of microwave-plasma-assisted chemical-vapor-deposition films grown on Si. The Raman lines in the films appear at higher frequency (shifts of up to 3 cm-1) than that of natural diamond and the observed lines are symmetric with broader linewidths than that of natural diamond, ranging from 5.7 to 17.1 cm-1. In addition, the line frequencies and linewidths are correlated; the films with the highest vibrational frequencies have the largest linewidths. The data include single-point measurements on eight films grown under different conditions as well as 500 data points from different positions on a single film that were obtained in a spatially resolved Raman experiment. Several mechanisms for the frequency shift and the correlation of the linewidth with frequency are considered including phonon confinement, residual stress, and defect scattering. Contrary to the observations, Raman line shapes computed from the phonon-confinement model (which has been used successfully to model Raman scattering in microcrystalline Si and GaAs), using phonon-dispersion curves for diamond from the literature, are highly asymmetric at the linewidths observed. It is concluded that the observed shifts in the diamond Raman line do not arise from phonon confinement alone and arise primarily from compressive stress. The line broadening also is not produced by phonon confinement alone and may arise from decreasing phonon lifetime associated with scattering from defects or from an inhomogeneous stress distribution in the films. The observed correlation between Raman line frequency and width suggests that the degree of compressive stress may be associated with the density of microcrystalline defects.},

The source is suitable for long distance quantum communication applications as the photon pairs are located at the centers of the telecommunication O-and C-band at 1312 nm and 1557 nm. The high efficiency is confirmed by a conversion efficiency of 4 × 10 −6 – which is to our knowledge among the highest conversion efficiencies reported so far – and a heralding efficiency of 64.1 ± 2.1{\%}. The heralded single-photon properties are confirmed by the measurement of the photon statistics with a Click/No-Click method as well as the heralded g (2) -function.

abstract = {We report on the experimental realization of an absolute single-photon source based on a single nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in a nanodiamond at room temperature and on the calculation of its absolute spectral photon flux from experimental data. The single-photon source was calibrated with respect to its photon flux and its spectral photon rate density. The photon flux was measured with a low-noise silicon photodiode traceable to the primary standard for optical flux, taking into account the absolute spectral power distribution using a calibrated spectroradiometer. The optical radiant flux is adjustable from 55 fW, which is almost the lowest detection limit for the silicon photodiode, and 75 fW, which is the saturation power of the NV center. These fluxes correspond to total photon flux rates between 190,000 photons per second and 260,000 photons per second, respectively. The single-photon emission purity is indicated by a g(2)(0) value, which is between 0.10 and 0.23, depending on the excitation power. To our knowledge, this is the first single-photon source absolutely calibrated with respect to its absolute optical radiant flux and spectral power distribution, traceable to the corresponding national standards via an unbroken traceability chain. The prospects for its application, e.g., for the detection efficiency calibration of single-photon detectors as well as for use as a standard photon source in the low photon flux regime, are promising.},

@article{Limpert2001,
abstract = {  As the need grows for conceptualization, formalization, and abstraction in biology, so too does mathematics' relevance to the field (Fagerstr{\"{o}}m et al. 1996). Mathematics is particularly important for analyzing and characterizing random variation of, for example, size and weight of individuals in populations, their sensitivity to chemicals, and time-to-event cases, such as the amount of time an individual needs to recover from illness. The frequency distribution of such data is a major factor determining the type of statistical analysis that can be validly carried out on any data set. Many widely used statistical methods, such as ANOVA (analysis of variance) and regression analysis, require that the data be normally distributed, but only rarely is the frequency distribution of data tested when these techniques are used.  The Gaussian (normal) distribution is most often assumed to describe the random variation that occurs in the data from many scientific disciplines; the well-known bell-shaped curve can easily be characterized and described by two values: the arithmetic mean {\textless}private-char description='[xmacr]' name='xmacr' value='xmacr'/{\textgreater} and the standard deviation s, so that data sets are commonly described by the expression {\textless}private-char description='[xmacr]' name='xmacr' value='xmacr'/{\textgreater} ± s. A historical example of a normal distribution is that of chest measurements of Scottish soldiers made by Quetelet, Belgian founder of modern social statistics (Swoboda 1974). In addition, such disparate phenomena as milk production by cows and random deviations from target values in industrial processes fit a normal distribution.  However, many measurements show a more or less skewed distribution. Skewed distributions are particularly common when mean values are low, variances large, and values cannot be negative, as is the case, for example, with species abundance, lengths of latent periods of infectious diseases, and distribution of mineral resources in the Earth's crust. Such skewed distributions often closely fit the log-normal distribution (Aitchison and Brown 1957, Crow and Shimizu 1988, Lee 1992, Johnson et al. 1994, Sachs 1997). Examples fitting the normal distribution, which is symmetrical, and the log-normal distribution, which is skewed, are given in Figure 1. Note that body height fits both distributions.  Often, biological mechanisms induce log-normal distributions (Koch 1966), as when, for instance, exponential growth is combined with further symmetrical variation: With a mean concentration of, say, 106 bacteria, one cell division more—or less—will lead to 2 × 106—or 5 — 105—cells. Thus, the range will be asymmetrical—to be precise, multiplied or divided by 2 around the mean. The skewed size distribution may be why “exceptionally” big fruit are reported in journals year after year in autumn. Such exceptions, however, may well be the rule: Inheritance of fruit and flower size has long been known to fit the log-normal distribution (Groth 1914, Powers 1936, Sinnot 1937).  What is the difference between normal and log-normal variability? Both forms of variability are based on a variety of forces acting independently of one another. A major difference, however, is that the effects can be additive or multiplicative, thus leading to normal or log-normal distributions, respectively.  Some basic principles of additive and multiplicative effects can easily be demonstrated with the help of two ordinary dice with sides numbered from 1 to 6. Adding the two numbers, which is the principle of most games, leads to values from 2 to 12, with a mean of 7, and a symmetrical frequency distribution. The total range can be described as 7 plus or minus 5 (that is, 7 ± 5) where, in this case, 5 is not the standard deviation. Multiplying the two numbers, however, leads to values between 1 and 36 with a highly skewed distribution. The total variability can be described as 6 multiplied or divided by 6 (or 6 ×/ 6). In this case, the symmetry has moved to the multiplicative level.  Although these examples are neither normal nor log-normal distributions, they do clearly indicate that additive and multiplicative effects give rise to different distributions. Thus, we cannot describe both types of distribution in the same way. Unfortunately, however, common belief has it that quantitative variability is generally bell shaped and symmetrical. The current practice in science is to use symmetrical bars in graphs to indicate standard deviations or errors, and the sign ± to summarize data, even though the data or the underlying principles may suggest skewed distributions (Factor et al. 2000, Keesing 2000, Le Naour et al. 2000, Rhew et al. 2000). In a number of cases the variability is clearly asymmetrical because subtracting three standard deviations from the mean produces negative values, as in the example 100 ± 50. Moreover, the example of the dice shows that the established way to characterize symmetrical, additive variability with the sign ± (plus or minus) has its equivalent in the handy sign ×/ (times or divided by), which will be discussed further below.  Log-normal distributions are usually characterized in terms of the log-transformed variable, using as parameters the expected value, or mean, of its distribution, and the standard deviation. This characterization can be advantageous as, by definition, log-normal distributions are symmetrical again at the log level.  Unfortunately, the widespread aversion to statistics becomes even more pronounced as soon as logarithms are involved. This may be the major reason that log-normal distributions are so little understood in general, which leads to frequent misunderstandings and errors. Plotting the data can help, but graphs are difficult to communicate orally. In short, current ways of handling log-normal distributions are often unwieldy.  To get an idea of a sample, most people prefer to think in terms of the original rather than the log-transformed data. This conception is indeed feasible and advisable for log-normal data, too, because the familiar properties of the normal distribution have their analogies in the log-normal distribution. To improve comprehension of log-normal distributions, to encourage their proper use, and to show their importance in life, we present a novel physical model for generating log-normal distributions, thus filling a 100-year-old gap. We also demonstrate the evolution and use of parameters allowing characterization of the data at the original scale. Moreover, we compare log-normal distributions from a variety of branches of science to elucidate patterns of variability, thereby reemphasizing the importance of log-normal distributions in life.   A physical model demonstrating the genesis of log-normal distributions Section:    Next section  There was reason for Galton (1889) to complain about colleagues who were interested only in averages and ignored random variability. In his thinking, variability was even part of the “charms of statistics.” Consequently, he presented a simple physical model to give a clear visualization of binomial and, finally, normal variability and its derivation.  Figure 2a shows a further development of this “Galton board,” in which particles fall down a board and are deviated at decision points (the tips of the triangular obstacles) either left or right with equal probability. (Galton used simple nails instead of the isosceles triangles shown here, so his invention resembles a pinball machine or the Japanese game Pachinko.) The normal distribution created by the board reflects the cumulative additive effects of the sequence of decision points.  A particle leaving the funnel at the top meets the tip of the first obstacle and is deviated to the left or right by a distance c with equal probability. It then meets the corresponding triangle in the second row, and is again deviated in the same manner, and so forth. The deviation of the particle from one row to the next is a realization of a random variable with possible values +c and −c, and with equal probability for both of them. Finally, after passing r rows of triangles, the particle falls into one of the r + 1 receptacles at the bottom. The probabilities of ending up in these receptacles, numbered 0, 1,{\ldots},r, follow a binomial law with parameters r and p = 0.5. When many particles have made their way through the obstacles, the height of the particles piled up in the several receptacles will be approximately proportional to the binomial probabilities.  For a large number of rows, the probabilities approach a normal density function according to the central limit theorem. In its simplest form, this mathematical law states that the sum of many (r) independent, identically distributed random variables is, in the limit as r→∞, normally distributed. Therefore, a Galton board with many rows of obstacles shows normal density as the expected height of particle piles in the receptacles, and its mechanism captures the idea of a sum of r independent random variables.  Figure 2b shows how Galton's construction was modified to describe the distribution of a product of such variables, which ultimately leads to a log-normal distribution. To this aim, scalene triangles are needed (although they appear to be isosceles in the figure), with the longer side to the right. Let the distance from the left edge of the board to the tip of the first obstacle below the funnel be xm. The lower corners of the first triangle are at xm {\textperiodcentered} c and xm/c (ignoring the gap necessary to allow the particles to pass between the obstacles). Therefore, the particle meets the tip of a triangle in the next row at X = xm {\textperiodcentered} c, or X = xm /c, with equal probabilities for both values. In the second and following rows, the triangles with the tip at distance x from the left edge have lower corners at x {\textperiodcentered} c and x/c (up to the gap width). Thus, the horizontal position of a particle is multiplied in each row by a random variable with equal probab},

abstract = {An outstanding goal in quantum information science is the faithful mapping of quantum information between a stable quantum memory and a reliable quantum communication channel. This would allow, for example, quantum communication over remote distances, quantum teleportation of matter and distributed quantum computing over a 'quantum internet'. Because quantum states cannot in general be copied, quantum information can only be distributed in these and other applications by entangling the quantum memory with the communication channel. Here we report quantum entanglement between an ideal quantum memory--represented by a single trapped 111Cd+ ion--and an ideal quantum communication channel, provided by a single photon that is emitted spontaneously from the ion. Appropriate coincidence measurements between the quantum states of the photon polarization and the trapped ion memory are used to verify their entanglement directly. Our direct observation of entanglement between stationary and 'flying' qubits is accomplished without using cavity quantum electrodynamic techniques or prepared non-classical light sources. We envision that this source of entanglement may be used for a variety of quantum communication protocols and for seeding large-scale entangled states of trapped ion qubits for scalable quantum computing.},

For such materials, quantum effects define their physical behaviour and open completely new (quantum) perspectives for applications. Carbon-based materials are particularly good examples, highlighted by the fascinating quantum properties of, for example, nanotubes or graphene. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of ultrapure isotopically controlled single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond with a remarkably low concentration of paramagnetic impurities. The content of nuclear spins associated with the (13)C isotope was depleted to 0.3{\%} and the concentration of other paramagnetic defects was measured to be {\textless}10(13) cm(-3). Being placed in such a spin-free lattice, single electron spins show the longest room-temperature spin dephasing times ever observed in solid-state systems (T2=1.8 ms). This benchmark will potentially allow observation of coherent coupling between spins separated by a few tens of nanometres, making it a versatile material for room-temperature quantum information processing devices. We also show that single electron spins in the same isotopically engineered CVD diamond can be used to detect external magnetic fields with a sensitivity reaching 4 nT Hz(-1/2) and subnanometre spatial resolution.},

abstract = {Employing photoluminescence(PL) spectroscopy, we have carried out a detailed study of the characteristics and origin of the 1.681 eV luminescence center in chemical‐vapor‐deposited (CVD)diamond films. In addition to the zero‐phonon line (ZPL), the fine structure of the PLemission spectrum revealed vibronics corresponding to both phonon emission and phonon absorption. Most of the vibronics can be identified with known lattice phonons in a natural diamond, although a few of the peaks appear to be associated with a local vibrational mode. The emission intensity was found to be a strong function of the CH4/H2 ratio used to grow the diamond films. Decreasing the methane concentration from 2.0{\%} to 0.25{\%} resulted in an increase of about four orders of magnitude in the PL intensity. It has been found that residual stress on the order of 0.5 GPa in the diamond film quenches the PL emission intensity but has no measurable effects on the peak position and half‐width of the 1.681 eV ZPL. Temperature has a marked influence on the PL emission characteristics. With increasing temperature, the emission intensity decreases, the peak position shifts to lower energy, and the half‐width broadens. Some of these results provide further support to the conclusion arrived at recently by some researchers that the 1.681 eV center, characteristic of ‘‘high‐quality,'' CVD‐grown diamond films, is not the GR1 center present in radiation‐damaged bulk diamond. The plausibility of the Si‐impurity model, proposed to explain the origin of this 1.681 eV center, was critically examined.},

abstract = {Carbon atoms form very strong bonds to each other yielding solid crystalline materials like graphite and diamond. Because of the high bonding energies, the vaporization and melting temperatures are very high. Different kinds of atom-to-atom bonding make many solid forms possible, ranging from pure graphite to pure diamond, as well as many types of molecules in liquid or gaseous carbon. Rigorous conditions of high temperature, high pressure, or both, are required to change a given elemental phase of carbon to another. Currently the vapor-pressure line of graphite, the P, T equilibrium line between graphite and diamond, and the graphite/diamond/liquid triple point are fairly well established. The triple point (or points) for graphite (or carbynes)/vapor/liquid remain controversial. At pressures less than 0.1 GPa liquid carbon seems to be a poor electric conductor while at higher pressures it is a good one. Current experimental and theoretical evidence indicate that diamond is stable against collapse to metallic forms (unlike Si and Ge) up to pressures over 350 GPa, and possibly as high as 2300 GPa. The latest static and shock compression experiments on diamond indicate that it melts to a conducting liquid at about 5000 K at pressures of 15 to 30 GPa, but does not melt at about 6000 K at 125 GPa. This suggests that the melting temperature of diamond increases with pressure, and that at the melting temperature liquid carbon is slightly less dense than diamond. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

The well-known nitrogen vacancy centres are characterized by several limitations, and thus few other defects have recently been considered. In the present work, we characterize, in detail, native efficient single colour centres emitting in the near infra-red ( {\$}\lambda{\$} = 740–780 nm) in both standard IIa single-crystal and electronic-grade polycrystalline commercial chemical vapour deposited (CVD) diamond samples. In the former case, a high-temperature ( T {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 1000 °C) annealing process in vacuum is necessary to induce the formation/activation of luminescent centres with good emission properties, while in the latter case the annealing process has marginally beneficial effects on the number and performance of native centres in commercially available samples. Although displaying significant variability in several photo-physical properties (emission wavelength, emission rate instabilities, saturation behaviours), these centres generally display appealing photophysical properties for applications as single photon sources: short lifetimes (0.7–3 ns), high emission rates (∼50–500 × 10 3 photons s −1 ) and strongly ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}95{\{}{\%}{\}}) polarized light. The native centres are tentatively attributed to impurities incorporated in the diamond crystal during the CVD growth of high-quality type-IIa samples, and offer promising perspectives in diamond-based photonics.},

It is shown that when the definition of the second is taken into account, a definition of the kilogram in terms of the mass of a photon of specified frequency results in a kilogram that implicitly depends on α 4 m e and other dimensionless constants, where α is the fine structure constant and m e is the electron rest mass. Thus the choice of definitions proposed by Mills et al implicitly yields a kilogram that depends either essentially on α 4 m e or on the unified atomic mass unit, m u . Consequently, the kilogram could be regarded as implicitly retaining its present status as an independently defined SI base unit with either definition. The α-dependence of the kilogram and many other SI quantities would, of course, be affected by future changes in the definition of the second.}
