abstract = {Nanodiamonds (NDs) hosting optically active defects are an important technical material for applications in quantum sensing, biological imaging, and quantum optics. The negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV) defect is known to fluoresce in molecular sized NDs (1 to 6 nm) and its spectral properties depend on the quality of the surrounding host lattice. This defect is therefore a good probe to investigate the material properties of small NDs. Here we report unprecedented narrow optical transitions for SiV colour centers hosted in nanodiamonds produced using a novel high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) technique. The SiV zero-phonon lines were measured to have an inhomogeneous distribution of 1.05 nm at 5 K across a sample of numerous NDs. Individual spectral lines as narrow as 354 MHz were measured for SiV centres in nanodiamonds smaller than 200 nm, which is four times narrower than the best SiV line previously reported for nanodiamonds. Correcting for apparent spectral diffusion yielded a homogeneous linewith of about 200 MHz, which is close to the width limit imposed by the radiative lifetime. These results demonstrate that the direct HPHT synthesis technique is capable of producing nanodiamonds with high crystal lattice quality, which are therefore a valuable technical material.},

abstract = {Quantum communication requires the transfer of quantum states, or quantum bits of information (qubits), from one place to another. From a fundamental perspective, this allows the distribution of entanglement and the demonstration of quantum non-locality over significant distances. Within the context of applications, quantum cryptography offers a provably secure way to establish a confidential key between distant partners. Photons represent the natural flying qubit carriers for quantum communication, and the presence of telecommunications optical fibres makes the wavelengths of 1,310 nm and 1,550 nm particularly suitable for distribution over long distances. However, qubits encoded into alkaline atoms that absorb and emit at wavelengths around 800 nm have been considered for the storage and processing of quantum information. Hence, future quantum information networks made of telecommunications channels and alkaline memories will require interfaces that enable qubit transfers between these useful wavelengths, while preserving quantum coherence and entanglement. Here we report a demonstration of qubit transfer between photons of wavelength 1,310 nm and 710 nm. The mechanism is a nonlinear up-conversion process, with a success probability of greater than 5 per cent. In the event of a successful qubit transfer, we observe strong two-photon interference between the 710 nm photon and a third photon at 1,550 nm, initially entangled with the 1,310 nm photon, although they never directly interacted. The corresponding fidelity is higher than 98 per cent.},

After pulsed-laser deposition of a thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer on silicon,iridium was deposited by e -beam evaporation. Subsequently, diamond nucleation and growth was performed in a chemical vapor deposition setup. The epitaxial orientation relationship measured by x-ray diffraction is diamond(001)[110]∥Ir(001)[110]∥YSZ(001) [110]∥Si(001)[110]. The mosaicity of the diamondfilms is about an order of magnitude lower than for deposition directly on silicon without buffer layers and nearly reaches the values reported for single-crystaldiamond on Ir/SrTiO 3 . In the effort towards single-crystaldiamond wafers, the present solution offers advantages over alternative growth substrates like large-area oxide single crystals due to the low thermal expansion mismatch.},

@article{Feng1993,
abstract = {Employing photoluminescence(PL) spectroscopy, we have carried out a detailed study of the characteristics and origin of the 1.681 eV luminescence center in chemical‐vapor‐deposited (CVD)diamond films. In addition to the zero‐phonon line (ZPL), the fine structure of the PLemission spectrum revealed vibronics corresponding to both phonon emission and phonon absorption. Most of the vibronics can be identified with known lattice phonons in a natural diamond, although a few of the peaks appear to be associated with a local vibrational mode. The emission intensity was found to be a strong function of the CH4/H2 ratio used to grow the diamond films. Decreasing the methane concentration from 2.0{\%} to 0.25{\%} resulted in an increase of about four orders of magnitude in the PL intensity. It has been found that residual stress on the order of 0.5 GPa in the diamond film quenches the PL emission intensity but has no measurable effects on the peak position and half‐width of the 1.681 eV ZPL. Temperature has a marked influence on the PL emission characteristics. With increasing temperature, the emission intensity decreases, the peak position shifts to lower energy, and the half‐width broadens. Some of these results provide further support to the conclusion arrived at recently by some researchers that the 1.681 eV center, characteristic of ‘‘high‐quality,'' CVD‐grown diamond films, is not the GR1 center present in radiation‐damaged bulk diamond. The plausibility of the Si‐impurity model, proposed to explain the origin of this 1.681 eV center, was critically examined.},

abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential to perform certain computational tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts. The Cirac-Zoller proposal for a scalable quantum computer is based on a string of trapped ions whose electronic states represent the quantum bits of information (or qubits). In this scheme, quantum logical gates involving any subset of ions are realized by coupling the ions through their collective quantized motion. The main experimental step towards realizing the scheme is to implement the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation between two individual ions. The CNOT quantum logical gate corresponds to the XOR gate operation of classical logic that flips the state of a target bit conditioned on the state of a control bit. Here we implement a CNOT quantum gate according to the Cirac-Zoller proposal. In our experiment, two 40Ca+ ions are held in a linear Paul trap and are individually addressed using focused laser beams; the qubits are represented by superpositions of two long-lived electronic states. Our work relies on recently developed precise control of atomic phases and the application of composite pulse sequences adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.},

abstract = {Photonic nanostructures provide a way of tailoring the interaction between light and matter and the past decade has witnessed a tremendous experimental and theoretical progress on this subject. In particular, the combination with semiconductor quantum dots has proven very successful. This manuscript reviews quantum optics with excitons in single quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures. The ability to engineer the interaction strength in integrated photonic nanostructures enables a range of fundamental quantum-electrodynamics experiments on, e.g., spontaneous-emission control, modified Lamb shifts, and enhanced dipole-dipole interaction. Furthermore, highly efficient single-photon sources and giant photon nonlinearities may be constructed with immediate applications for photonic quantum-information processing. The review summarizes the general theoretical framework of photon emission including the role of dephasing processes, and applies it to photonic nanostructures of current interest, such as photonic-crystal cavities and waveguides, dielectric nanowires, and plasmonic waveguides. Finally, the progress and future prospects of applications in quantum-information processing are considered.},

Based on this nano-manipulation technique, we experimentally demonstrate the evanescent coupling of single fluorescence photons emitted by a single NV-center to the guided mode of the TOF. By comparing photon count rates of the fiber-guided and the free-space modes and with the help of numerical finite-difference time domain simulations, we determine a lower and upper bound for the coupling efficiency of (9.5 ± 0.6){\%} and (10.4 ± 0.7){\%}, respectively.

One of the central challenges in the realization of such a deterministic device based on a single quantum emitter concerns the collection of the photons, which are radiated into a 4$\pi$ solid angle. Here, we present the fabrication and characterization of an optical antenna designed to convert the dipolar radiation of an arbitrarily oriented quantum emitter to a directional beam with more than 99{\%} efficiency. Our approach is extremely versatile and can be used for more efficient detection of nanoscopic emitters ranging from semiconductor quantum dots to dye molecules, color centers, or rare-earth ions in various environments. Having addressed the issue of collection efficiency, we also discuss the photophysical limitations of the existing quantum emitters for the realization of a deterministic single-photon source.},

After pulsed-laser deposition of a thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer on silicon,iridium was deposited by e -beam evaporation. Subsequently, diamond nucleation and growth was performed in a chemical vapor deposition setup. The epitaxial orientation relationship measured by x-ray diffraction is diamond(001)[110]∥Ir(001)[110]∥YSZ(001) [110]∥Si(001)[110]. The mosaicity of the diamondfilms is about an order of magnitude lower than for deposition directly on silicon without buffer layers and nearly reaches the values reported for single-crystaldiamond on Ir/SrTiO 3 . In the effort towards single-crystaldiamond wafers, the present solution offers advantages over alternative growth substrates like large-area oxide single crystals due to the low thermal expansion mismatch.},

We report on density-functional-based tight-binding molecular-dynamics calculations of high-energy high-angle twist (100) grain boundaries in diamond as a model for the UNCD grain boundaries. About one-half of the carbons in the grain boundary are threefold coordinated and are responsible for states introduced into the band gap. Simulations were also performed for N, Si, and H impurities in (100) twist grain boundaries where substitution energies, optimized geometries, and electronic structures were calculated. Substitution energies were found to be substantially lower for the grain boundaries compared to the bulk diamond crystal. Nitrogen increases the number of threefold-coordinated carbons while hydrogen saturates dangling bonds. The electronic structure of UNCD is characterized by a large number of states in the band gap attributed to the bonding disorder and impurities in the grain boundaries.},

abstract = {An outstanding goal in quantum information science is the faithful mapping of quantum information between a stable quantum memory and a reliable quantum communication channel. This would allow, for example, quantum communication over remote distances, quantum teleportation of matter and distributed quantum computing over a 'quantum internet'. Because quantum states cannot in general be copied, quantum information can only be distributed in these and other applications by entangling the quantum memory with the communication channel. Here we report quantum entanglement between an ideal quantum memory--represented by a single trapped 111Cd+ ion--and an ideal quantum communication channel, provided by a single photon that is emitted spontaneously from the ion. Appropriate coincidence measurements between the quantum states of the photon polarization and the trapped ion memory are used to verify their entanglement directly. Our direct observation of entanglement between stationary and 'flying' qubits is accomplished without using cavity quantum electrodynamic techniques or prepared non-classical light sources. We envision that this source of entanglement may be used for a variety of quantum communication protocols and for seeding large-scale entangled states of trapped ion qubits for scalable quantum computing.},

abstract = {Single-photon sources are a fundamental element for developing quantum technologies, and sources based on colour centres in diamonds are among the most promising candidates. The well-known nitrogen vacancy centres are characterized by several limitations, and thus few other defects have recently been considered. In the present work, we characterize, in detail, native efficient single colour centres emitting in the near infra-red ( $\lambda$ = 740–780 nm) in both standard IIa single-crystal and electronic-grade polycrystalline commercial chemical vapour deposited (CVD) diamond samples. In the former case, a high-temperature ( T {\textgreater} 1000 °C) annealing process in vacuum is necessary to induce the formation/activation of luminescent centres with good emission properties, while in the latter case the annealing process has marginally beneficial effects on the number and performance of native centres in commercially available samples. Although displaying significant variability in several photo-physical properties (emission wavelength, emission rate instabilities, saturation behaviours), these centres generally display appealing photophysical properties for applications as single photon sources: short lifetimes (0.7–3 ns), high emission rates (∼50–500 × 10 3 photons s −1 ) and strongly ({\textgreater}95{\%}) polarized light. The native centres are tentatively attributed to impurities incorporated in the diamond crystal during the CVD growth of high-quality type-IIa samples, and offer promising perspectives in diamond-based photonics.},

The Raman line was found to become more asymmetric with some tailing towards lower Raman shifts, broader, and weaker with decreasing particle size. The observed result can be explained by a phonon confinement effect rather than by a strain effect. This work predicts that it is very difficult to detect Raman spectra of diamond particles with size less than ∼50 {\AA}. A broad Raman band, whose intensity becomes stronger with decreasing particle size, was observed around 600 cm-1 in the spectra of diamond powders with particle size less than 2 $\mu$m. We hypothesize that the broad band arises from transverse acoustic phonons near the Brillouin zone boundary because of the relaxation in the wave vector selection rule.},

However, efficient optical excitation and detection of such emitters involves large solid angles because their interaction with freely propagating light is omnidirectional. Here, we present unidirectional emission of a single emitter by coupling to a nanofabricated Yagi-Uda antenna. A quantum dot is placed in the near field of the antenna so that it drives the resonant feed element of the antenna. The resulting quantum-dot luminescence is strongly polarized and highly directed into a narrow forward angular cone. The directionality of the quantum dot can be controlled by tuning the antenna dimensions. Our results show the potential of optical antennas to communicate energy to, from, and between nano-emitters.},

abstract = {Optical centers in natural diamonds from the Argyle mine have been characterized by absorption and photoluminescence techniques. Many of those diamonds show characteristic PL spectra with a large number of slowly decaying centers, most of which can be attributed to the Ni impurity. A linear correlation was observed between the intensity of the 3107 cm-1 hydrogen-related peak and the concentration of IR-active nitrogen. It may be accounted for by the presence of NH3, NH4 and N2 gases as sources of nitrogen during diamond growth. It is shown that the unique blue-gray color of some Argyle diamonds is determined not only by the high hydrogen content, but also a small concentration of tri-nitrogen complexes in combination with a large concentration of two- and four-nitrogen defects. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The simultaneous confinement of photons and phonons leads to an optomechanical interaction that we calculate in a perturbation approach.

For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations.

Both, cavity in- and out-put are directly fiber-coupled, and the emission wavelength is easily tunable by variation of the separation of the two mirrors with a piezo-electric crystal. By coupling to the cavity, we achieve an increase of the spectral photon rate density by two orders of magnitude compared to free-space emission of the NV center.

abstract = {The optimization of diamond films as valuable engineering materials for a wide variety of applications has required the development of robust methods for their characterization. Of the many methods used, Raman microscopy is perhaps the most valuable because it provides readily distinguishable signatures of each of the different forms of carbon (e.g. diamond, graphite, buckyballs). In addition it is non-destructive, requires little or no specimen preparation, is performed in air and can produce spatially resolved maps of the different forms of carbon within a specimen. This article begins by reviewing the strengths (and some of the pitfalls) of the Raman technique for the analysis of diamond and diamond films and surveys some of the latest developments (for example, surface-enhanced Raman and ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy) which hold the promise of providing a more profound understanding of the outstanding properties of these materials. The remainder of the article is devoted to the uses of Raman spectroscopy in diamond science and technology. Topics covered include using Raman spectroscopy to assess stress, crystalline perfection, phase purity, crystallite size, point defects and doping in diamond and diamond films.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the controlled preparation of heteroepitaxialdiamond nano- and microstructures on silicon wafer based iridium films as hosts for single color centers. Our approach uses electron beam lithography followed by reactive ion etching to pattern the carbon layer formed by bias enhanced nucleation on the iridium surface. In the subsequent chemical vapor deposition process, the patterned areas evolve into regular arrays of (001) oriented diamond nano-islands with diameters of {\textless}500 nm and a height of ≈60 nm. In the islands, we identify single SiV color centers with narrow zero phonon lines down to 1 nm at room temperature.},

The LHCb preshower detector provides the longitudinal segmentation of the electromagnetic shower detection. It is located immediately upstream from the ECAL, with one-to-one correspondence between ECAL towers, SPD and preshower cells. The PS detector is part of the first level of the LHCb trigger system (called Level-0). It is used in conjunction with the SPD, ECAL and HCAL to search for clusters of 2 × 2 cells and to identify e, $\gamma$ , $\pi$°, hadron of highest E T . This contribution discusses the requirements for the synchronisation and calibration of the PS detector, as well as the methods that were used to determine the first settings before the LHC start-up. The methods used to perform the fine synchronisation and calibration once LHC collisions were available are introduced, and the precisions that were obtained are given.},

The major quantum sensor and qubit candidate in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center. This lattice defect comes in four different crystallographic orientations leading to an intrinsic inhomogeneity among NV centers that is undesirable in some applications. Here, we report a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor decomposition (MPCVD) diamond growth technique on (111)-oriented substrates that yields perfect alignment (94$\backslash$pm2{\%}) of as-grown NV centers along a single crystallographic direction. In addition, clear evidence is found that the majority (74$\backslash$pm4{\%}) of the aligned NV centers were formed by the nitrogen being first included in the (111) growth surface and then followed by the formation of a neighboring vacancy on top. The achieved homogeneity of the grown NV centers will tremendously benefit quantum information and metrology applications.},

abstract = {The exploitation of emerging quantum technologies requires efficient fabrication of key building blocks. Sources of single photons are extremely important across many applications as they can serve as vectors for quantum information—thereby allowing long-range (perhaps even global-scale) quantum states to be made and manipulated for tasks such as quantum communication or distributed quantum computation. At the single-emitter level, quantum sources also afford new possibilities in terms of nanoscopy and bio-marking. Color centers in diamond are prominent candidates to generate and manipulate quantum states of light, as they are a photostable solid-state source of single photons at room temperature. In this review, we discuss the state of the art of diamond-based single-photon emitters and highlight their fabrication methodologies. We present the experimental techniques used to characterize the quantum emitters and discuss their photophysical properties. We outline a number of applications including quantum key distribution, bio-marking and sub-diffraction imaging, where diamond-based single emitters are playing a crucial role. We conclude with a discussion of the main challenges and perspectives for employing diamond emitters in quantum information processing.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement is among the most fascinating aspects of quantum theory. Entangled optical photons are now widely used for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and applications such as quantum cryptography. Several recent experiments demonstrated entanglement of optical photons with trapped ions, atoms and atomic ensembles, which are then used to connect remote long-term memory nodes in distributed quantum networks. Here we realize quantum entanglement between the polarization of a single optical photon and a solid-state qubit associated with the single electronic spin of a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond. Our experimental entanglement verification uses the quantum eraser technique, and demonstrates that a high degree of control over interactions between a solid-state qubit and the quantum light field can be achieved. The reported entanglement source can be used in studies of fundamental quantum phenomena and provides a key building block for the solid-state realization of quantum optical networks.},

The challenge for utilizing this centre is to realize the hitherto elusive optical access to its electronic spin.

abstract = {Quantum entanglement between spatially separated objects is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics. The outcomes of independent measurements on entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. As well as being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled quantum bits (qubits) can be used to share private information or implement quantum logical gates. Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled qubits are spatially separated, providing the opportunity to create highly connected quantum networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here we report entanglement of two electron spin qubits in diamond with a spatial separation of three metres. We establish this entanglement using a robust protocol based on creation of spin-photon entanglement at each location and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations on local long-lived nuclear spin registers, paving the way for deterministic long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks.},

@article{Moehring2007,
abstract = {Quantum information science involves the storage, manipulation and communication of information encoded in quantum systems, where the phenomena of superposition and entanglement can provide enhancements over what is possible classically. Large-scale quantum information processors require stable and addressable quantum memories, usually in the form of fixed quantum bits (qubits), and a means of transferring and entangling the quantum information between memories that may be separated by macroscopic or even geographic distances. Atomic systems are excellent quantum memories, because appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store qubits over very long timescales. Photons, on the other hand, are the natural platform for the distribution of quantum information between remote qubits, given their ability to traverse large distances with little perturbation. Recently, there has been considerable progress in coupling small samples of atomic gases through photonic channels, including the entanglement between light and atoms and the observation of entanglement signatures between remotely located atomic ensembles. In contrast to atomic ensembles, single-atom quantum memories allow the implementation of conditional quantum gates through photonic channels, a key requirement for quantum computing. Along these lines, individual atoms have been coupled to photons in cavities, and trapped atoms have been linked to emitted photons in free space. Here we demonstrate the entanglement of two fixed single-atom quantum memories separated by one metre. Two remotely located trapped atomic ions each emit a single photon, and the interference and detection of these photons signals the entanglement of the atomic qubits. We characterize the entangled pair by directly measuring qubit correlations with near-perfect detection efficiency. Although this entanglement method is probabilistic, it is still in principle useful for subsequent quantum operations and scalable quantum information applications.},

The device consists of two concave mirrors each directly fabricated on the facets of two optical fibers and a preselected nanodiamond containing a single NV center deposited onto one of these mirrors. Both, cavity in- and output are directly fiber-coupled and the emission wavelength is easily tunable by variation of the separation of the two mirrors with a piezo-electric crystal. By coupling to the cavity we achieve an increase of the spectral photon rate density by two orders of magnitude compared to free-space emission of the NV center.

abstract = {Employing photoluminescence(PL) spectroscopy, we have carried out a detailed study of the characteristics and origin of the 1.681 eV luminescence center in chemical‐vapor‐deposited (CVD)diamond films. In addition to the zero‐phonon line (ZPL), the fine structure of the PLemission spectrum revealed vibronics corresponding to both phonon emission and phonon absorption. Most of the vibronics can be identified with known lattice phonons in a natural diamond, although a few of the peaks appear to be associated with a local vibrational mode. The emission intensity was found to be a strong function of the CH4/H2 ratio used to grow the diamond films. Decreasing the methane concentration from 2.0{\%} to 0.25{\%} resulted in an increase of about four orders of magnitude in the PL intensity. It has been found that residual stress on the order of 0.5 GPa in the diamond film quenches the PL emission intensity but has no measurable effects on the peak position and half‐width of the 1.681 eV ZPL. Temperature has a marked influence on the PL emission characteristics. With increasing temperature, the emission intensity decreases, the peak position shifts to lower energy, and the half‐width broadens. Some of these results provide further support to the conclusion arrived at recently by some researchers that the 1.681 eV center, characteristic of ‘‘high‐quality,'' CVD‐grown diamond films, is not the GR1 center present in radiation‐damaged bulk diamond. The plausibility of the Si‐impurity model, proposed to explain the origin of this 1.681 eV center, was critically examined.},

abstract = {The Si-V defect center in diamond (737??nm; 1.682??eV) was long thought to occur only in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown or Si-doped HPHT-grown synthetic diamonds. We report, for the first time, the occurrence of the Si-V defect in ten gem-quality colorless natural diamonds. Many of these samples, including type IIa and Ia diamonds, contained included crystals of olivine (Fo93-95) and garnet (Ca-Mg-rich), proving their natural origin. The 737??nm photoluminescence feature (actually a doublet at 736.5 and 736.9??nm at 77??K) occurred in association with several additional and previously unreported peaks at 524.4, 550.4, 554.3, 557.9, 558.2, 573.5, 593.3, 594.8, and 714.7??nm, as well as two series of peaks in the ranges 535-539 and 644-652??nm. The intensities of the associated peaks were proportional to the 737 features, suggesting their association with Si as well. Based on olivine (Fo0.93-0.95) and garnet inclusion (Ca, Mg-rich) chemistry, these diamonds are peridotitic in nature, likely having formed in the upper mantle. The source of the Si remains unclear. Care must be taken to avoid confusion between these natural Si-V diamonds and CVD synthetic diamonds with Si-V features. Fortunately, many of the commonly reported CVD identification features are absent from natural Si-V diamonds, facilitating the separation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m 3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

abstract = {Teleportation of a quantum state encompasses the complete transfer of information from one particle to another. The complete specification of the quantum state of a system generally requires an infinite amount of information, even for simple two-level systems (qubits). Moreover, the principles of quantum mechanics dictate that any measurement on a system immediately alters its state, while yielding at most one bit of information. The transfer of a state from one system to another (by performing measurements on the first and operations on the second) might therefore appear impossible. However, it has been shown that the entangling properties of quantum mechanics, in combination with classical communication, allow quantum-state teleportation to be performed. Teleportation using pairs of entangled photons has been demonstrated, but such techniques are probabilistic, requiring post-selection of measured photons. Here, we report deterministic quantum-state teleportation between a pair of trapped calcium ions. Following closely the original proposal, we create a highly entangled pair of ions and perform a complete Bell-state measurement involving one ion from this pair and a third source ion. State reconstruction conditioned on this measurement is then performed on the other half of the entangled pair. The measured fidelity is 75{\%}, demonstrating unequivocally the quantum nature of the process.},

abstract = {This work extensively investigates single silicon vacancy (SiV) color centers in diamond which are promising candidates for solid state single photon sources. The SiV centers are hosted by synthetic chemical vapor deposition diamonds in which they are created during the growth due to the incorporation of silicon impurities. The SiV centers display outstanding spectral properties including bright zero-phonon-lines (ZPLs, wavelengths mostly between 736 nm and 746 nm) with linewidths as narrow as 0.7 nm together with a distinct concentration of the fluorescence (approx. 70{\%}) in the ZPL. With single photon count rates up to 6.2 Mcps under continuous excitation, SiV centers are the brightest single color centers at present. Intensity auto-correlation measurements reveal three level population dynamics including a shelving state from which the SiV center can be reactivated by the excitation laser. Besides the ZPL, we identify previously unobserved electronic transitions in the spectral range between 820 nm and 840 nm. Using polarization spectroscopy, we investigate for the first time the transition dipole(s) for a single SiV center and find a single {\textless}110{\textgreater}-oriented dipole enabling fully linearly polarized single photon emission. Spectroscopy at cryogenic temperature for the first time reveals the ZPL fine structure of a single SiV center as well as mostly temperature independent population dynamics. In dieser Arbeit werden einzelne Silizium-Fehlstellen (SiV) Farbzentren in Diamant untersucht. Diese sind vielversprechende Kandidaten f{\"{u}}r festk{\"{o}}rperbasierte Einzelphotonenquellen. Die SiV Zentren entstehen w{\"{a}}hrend des Wachstums in synthetischen, durch Gasphasenabscheidung hergestellten Diamanten aus Silizium-Verunreinigungen. SiV Zentren zeigen herausragende spektrale Eigenschaften darunter eine intensive Null-Phononen (NP) Linie (Wellenl{\"{a}}nge meist zwischen 736 nm und 746 nm) mit einer Breite von minimal nur 0.7 nm zusammen mit einer ausgepr{\"{a}}gten Konzentration der Fluoreszenz (ca. 70{\%}) in der NP Linie. SiV Zentren sind mit Einzelphotonenraten bis zu 6.2 Mcps bei kontinuierlicher Anregung die hellsten einzelnen Farbzentren zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt. Intensit{\"{a}}ts-Autokorrelationsmessungen zeigen eine Drei-Niveau Besetzungsdynamik mit einem Shelving Zustand, aus dem das SiV Zentrum durch den Anregungslaser reaktiviert werden kann. Neben der NP Linie werden erstmals elektronische {\"{U}}berg{\"{a}}nge zwischen 820 nm und 840 nm identifiziert. Mit Hilfe von Polarisationsspektroskopie wird die Dipolausrichtung einzelner SiV Zentren untersucht und ein einzelner Dipol in {\textless}110{\textgreater} Kristallrichtung identifiziert. Tieftemperaturspektroskopie liefert erstmals die Feinstruktur der NP Linie eines einzelnen SiV Zentrums und zeigt eine weitgehend temperaturunabh{\"{a}}ngige Besetzungsdynamik.},

abstract = {Characterization of different types of gem-quality diamonds with UV-VIS-NIR, FTIR and EDXRF spectroscopy reveals a number of optical centers. The colour of the diamonds is clearly caused by a combination of some or all of these centers. Other optically inactive defects can have an effect on the colour of a diamond by influencing the Fermi-level: The relative concentrations of different charged states of a defect in diamond is determined by the Fermi-level. A topographic short-wave UV (225 nm) fluorescence study of growth sector-dependent inclusion of defects in natural diamonds with different colours is also presented. These measurements show that fluorescencent defect centers decorate defect structures connected to growth history of the diamond. On the basis of these characterisation techniques, some interrelationships between different coloured diamonds are highlighted. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The major quantum sensor and qubit candidate in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center. This lattice defect comes in four different crystallographic orientations leading to an intrinsic inhomogeneity among NV centers that is undesirable in some applications. Here, we report a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor decomposition (MPCVD) diamond growth technique on (111)-oriented substrates that yields perfect alignment (94$\backslash$pm2{\%}) of as-grown NV centers along a single crystallographic direction. In addition, clear evidence is found that the majority (74$\backslash$pm4{\%}) of the aligned NV centers were formed by the nitrogen being first included in the (111) growth surface and then followed by the formation of a neighboring vacancy on top. The achieved homogeneity of the grown NV centers will tremendously benefit quantum information and metrology applications.},

This would allow, for example, quantum communication over remote distances, quantum teleportation of matter and distributed quantum computing over a 'quantum internet'. Because quantum states cannot in general be copied, quantum information can only be distributed in these and other applications by entangling the quantum memory with the communication channel. Here we report quantum entanglement between an ideal quantum memory--represented by a single trapped 111Cd+ ion--and an ideal quantum communication channel, provided by a single photon that is emitted spontaneously from the ion. Appropriate coincidence measurements between the quantum states of the photon polarization and the trapped ion memory are used to verify their entanglement directly. Our direct observation of entanglement between stationary and 'flying' qubits is accomplished without using cavity quantum electrodynamic techniques or prepared non-classical light sources. We envision that this source of entanglement may be used for a variety of quantum communication protocols and for seeding large-scale entangled states of trapped ion qubits for scalable quantum computing.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement between spatially separated objects is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics. The outcomes of independent measurements on entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. As well as being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled quantum bits (qubits) can be used to share private information or implement quantum logical gates. Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled qubits are spatially separated, providing the opportunity to create highly connected quantum networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here we report entanglement of two electron spin qubits in diamond with a spatial separation of three metres. We establish this entanglement using a robust protocol based on creation of spin-photon entanglement at each location and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations on local long-lived nuclear spin registers, paving the way for deterministic long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks.},

Here, we report a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor decomposition (MPCVD) diamond growth technique on (111)-oriented substrates that yields perfect alignment ({\$}94\backslashpm2{\%}{\$}) of as-grown NV centers along a single crystallographic direction. In addition, clear evidence is found that the majority ({\$}74\backslashpm4{\%}{\$}) of the aligned NV centers were formed by the nitrogen being first included in the (111) growth surface and then followed by the formation of a neighboring vacancy on top. The achieved homogeneity of the grown NV centers will tremendously benefit quantum information and metrology applications.},

abstract = {The presence of large amounts of nondiamond carbon in detonation-synthesized nanodiamond (ND) severely limits applications of this exciting nanomaterial. We report on a simple and environmentally friendly route involving oxidation in air to selectively remove sp(2)-bonded carbon from ND. Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ Raman spectroscopy shows that sp(2) and sp(3) carbon species oxidize with different rates at 375-450 degrees C and reveals a narrow temperature range of 400-430 degrees C in which the oxidation of sp(2)-bonded carbon occurs with no or minimal loss of diamond. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy detects an increase of up to 2 orders of magnitude in the sp(3)/sp(2) ratio after oxidation. The content of up to 96{\%} of sp(3)-bonded carbon in the oxidized samples is comparable to that found in microcrystalline diamond and is unprecedented for ND powders. Transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies show high purity 5-nm ND particles covered by oxygen-containing surface functional groups. The surface functionalization can be controlled by subsequent treatments (e.g., hydrogenization). In contrast to current purification techniques, the air oxidation process does not require the use of toxic or aggressive chemicals, catalysts, or inhibitors and opens avenues for numerous new applications of nanodiamond.},

However, its electronic structure so far has remained elusive. We here explore the electronic structure by exposing single SiV defects to a magnetic field where the Zeeman effect lifts the degeneracy of magnetic sublevels. The similar response of single centers and a SiV ensemble in a low strain reference sample proves our ability to fabricate almost perfect single SiVs, revealing the true nature of the defect's electronic properties. We model the electronic states using a group-theoretical approach yielding a good agreement with the experimental observations. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts polarization measurements on single SiV centers and explains recently discovered spin selective excitation of SiV defects.},

@article{Tanzilli2005,
abstract = {Quantum communication requires the transfer of quantum states, or quantum bits of information (qubits), from one place to another. From a fundamental perspective, this allows the distribution of entanglement and the demonstration of quantum non-locality over significant distances. Within the context of applications, quantum cryptography offers a provably secure way to establish a confidential key between distant partners. Photons represent the natural flying qubit carriers for quantum communication, and the presence of telecommunications optical fibres makes the wavelengths of 1,310 nm and 1,550 nm particularly suitable for distribution over long distances. However, qubits encoded into alkaline atoms that absorb and emit at wavelengths around 800 nm have been considered for the storage and processing of quantum information. Hence, future quantum information networks made of telecommunications channels and alkaline memories will require interfaces that enable qubit transfers between these useful wavelengths, while preserving quantum coherence and entanglement. Here we report a demonstration of qubit transfer between photons of wavelength 1,310 nm and 710 nm. The mechanism is a nonlinear up-conversion process, with a success probability of greater than 5 per cent. In the event of a successful qubit transfer, we observe strong two-photon interference between the 710 nm photon and a third photon at 1,550 nm, initially entangled with the 1,310 nm photon, although they never directly interacted. The corresponding fidelity is higher than 98 per cent.},

@article{Kanda2006,
abstract = {We have reported previously that cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra of type II diamond change with irradiation of 20 kV electron beam using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), although it is known that diamond has high resistance against radiation beams. Following the previous paper, the diamond irradiated with the electron beam was annealed at 500 °C, and the CL spectra were measured. It was found from the annealed sample that the CL spectra which changed with the irradiation are partially recovered, namely, the lines at 420 nm and 540 nm formed with the irradiation are annealed out, and the lines at 485 nm, 535 nm and 545 nm which disappeared with the irradiation are recovered. However the 420 nm broad band that appeared with the irradiation does not change with the heat treatment. The effect of the heat treatment suggests that the CL peaks which changed with the irradiation are related to ionization of defects.},

@article{Iii1991,
abstract = {The frequency and line shape of the diamond Raman line are examined in detail for a series of microwave-plasma-assisted chemical-vapor-deposition films grown on Si. The Raman lines in the films appear at higher frequency (shifts of up to 3 cm-1) than that of natural diamond and the observed lines are symmetric with broader linewidths than that of natural diamond, ranging from 5.7 to 17.1 cm-1. In addition, the line frequencies and linewidths are correlated; the films with the highest vibrational frequencies have the largest linewidths. The data include single-point measurements on eight films grown under different conditions as well as 500 data points from different positions on a single film that were obtained in a spatially resolved Raman experiment. Several mechanisms for the frequency shift and the correlation of the linewidth with frequency are considered including phonon confinement, residual stress, and defect scattering. Contrary to the observations, Raman line shapes computed from the phonon-confinement model (which has been used successfully to model Raman scattering in microcrystalline Si and GaAs), using phonon-dispersion curves for diamond from the literature, are highly asymmetric at the linewidths observed. It is concluded that the observed shifts in the diamond Raman line do not arise from phonon confinement alone and arise primarily from compressive stress. The line broadening also is not produced by phonon confinement alone and may arise from decreasing phonon lifetime associated with scattering from defects or from an inhomogeneous stress distribution in the films. The observed correlation between Raman line frequency and width suggests that the degree of compressive stress may be associated with the density of microcrystalline defects.},
