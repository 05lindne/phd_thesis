\chaptermark{Fabrication of Nanodiamonds}

	In this chapter, different fabrication methods of nanodiamonds are explained.
	At first, the high-pressure high-temperature method is described. 
	It is similar to the processes which occur when natural diamond is formed within earth and is widly used to synthetically produce low-quality diamonds for industry\todo{verify}.
	Second, the Chemical Vapor Deposition method is described. 
	Not only did many measurements which are subject in this thesis get carried out on nanodiamonds produced with this techinique, but it is also the prerequisite for the third method mentioned, the wet-milling in a vibrational mill.
	The main focus of this thesis is on wet-milling nanodiamonds, which is a novel technique using chemical vapor deposition diamond as starting material.Â 
	At the end, the method of producing diamonds via a detonation process is briefly described.
	As diamonds produced with this process is not scope of this thesis, it will only be shortly introduced to complete the list.
