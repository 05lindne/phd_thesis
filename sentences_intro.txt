sentences for my thesis intro from project proposal, paper Zwinkels2010, and paper Cheung2007

Within the last few years the emerging topic of quantum technologies has witnessed a large progress in fields like quantum kryptography, quantum computation and quantum metrology.

A basic technology required for this progress is the development of single photon sources with well defined properties.

full quantum mechanical state for applications in metrology and quantum communication has to be known: quantitative parameters (e.g. photon count rate, quantum efficiency) and qualitative parameters (e.g. photon statistics, Fock state decomposition)

only pure single photon emitters of well defined emission wavelength and emission rate can be used as an absolute
